              README.first

This directory contains the current release of GAP. It is version 4.3.

All files are available in the following formats:

  - with extension .tar.gz    ---    standard format for UNIX/Linux systems 
                                     (use tar and gunzip for unpacking)

  - with extension .zip       ---    standard format for Windows/DOS systems
                                     (here text files have DOS-style line
                                      breaks, they might not work under Unix)

  - with extension .zoo       ---    all systems, use the provided
                                     util/unzoo.c, (UNIX)
                                     bin/win/unzoo.exe, (Windows)
                                     bin/mac/unzoo4r3-68k.sit, (Mac 68K)
                                     bin/mac/unzoo4r3-PPC.sit  (Mac PPC)
                                     for unpacking

The following contains brief installation  instructions. Please refer to the
files INSTALL  (UNIX), INSTALL-MAC.TEX (Mac) or  INSTALL.WIN (Windows), also
to be found in this directory, for more detailed instructions.

For a complete installation fetch the files

     or
   gapmac4r3....            ---  Mac
     or
   gappc4r3....             ---  Windows

and  (probably some time after the first release of GAP 4.3)

   bugfixes/fix*...
     and
   bugfixes/wbin*...  ---  these only for Windows

and (Mac only, choose most recent, PPC or 68k version)

   bin/mac/unzoo4r3-PPC.sit
   bin/mac/unzoo4r3-68k.sit
   
and  (these contain the current versions of all packages)

   accpkg4r3....
   deppkg4r3....

INSTALLATION UNDER UNIX

While the first mentioned files must  be unpacked *above* the root directory
you want to install GAP  in (say, '/usr/local/lib/', a subdirectory 'gap4r3'
is created), the  last two package collections must be  unpacked *inside the
'pkg'* subdirectory  of the distribution.  Bugfixes are unpacked  inside the
GAP root directory ('gap4r3').

To compile GAP on UNIX/Linux systems you can often just say

  ./configure
  make

inside  GAP's root  directory and  copy  the start  script bin/gap.sh  under
some  name (probably  'gap')  into  a generally  used  bin directory  (e.g.,
/usr/local/bin).

Note  that some  packages need  further installation/configuration.  See the
README.* files in the 'pkg' subdirectory.

You can  find further installation/setup  hints in the file  README.UNIX, it
also includes a script which potentially automates the whole installation on
Linux/UNIX systems.


INSTALLATION UNDER WINDOWS

Decompress  'gappc4r3.zip'  on the  top-level  directory of drive  C:\. This
creates  a  directory  C:\gap4r3,  the 'GAP  root directory'.  Then  extract
'accpkg4r3.zoo' and 'deppkg4r3' in C:\gap4r3\pkg\.
Click on C:\gap4r3\bin\gap.pif  to start GAP.

To make GAP accessible from the start menu, create a link 'GAP 4.3' to
C:\gap4r3\bin\gap.pif in a submenu of the start menu of your choice.

(If you want to install GAP in another directory, you will have to create
a suitable batch file -- see the file INSTALL.WIN or the chapter
'Installing GAP' of the reference manual.)

For getting  access to the  documentation via the  start menu, you  can also
create such  links to the manual books, e.g. to C:\gap4r3\doc\ref\manual.dvi
resp. C:\gap4r3\doc\ref\manual.pdf  resp. C:\gap4r3\doc\htm\ref\chapters.htm
for the  DVI-, PDF- resp. HTML  version of the  reference manual.  Of course,
this requires viewers for the respective types of files to be installed.

You can get  a considerably better user interface by  replacing the standard
DOS shell by the rxvt shell (see http://www.rxvt.org/). However, please note
that we cannot provide support for this shell.

If there are bugfixes, move them  into the 'gap4r3' directory and decompress
them there.


INSTALLATION ON THE MAC

Decompress 'bin4r3-...sit' and 'unzoo4r3-...sit' (using, e. g. , Stuffit
Expander). You should now have applications 'GAP 4 ...' and 'unzoo 4.3 ...'.
Note that .zoo files can be decompressed by dragging them onto the 'unzoo' 
application icon.

Move gapmac4r3.zoo into the folder in which you want to install GAP and
decompress it. Move 'accpkg4r3.zoo' and 'deppkg4r3' into the folder 'pkg' 
inside 'gap4r3' and decompress them.

If there are bugfixes, move them into the 'gap4r3' folder and decompress
them there.

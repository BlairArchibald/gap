\Chapter{Stabilizer Chains}

This  chapter contains some rather  technical complements to the material
handled  in chapter~"ref:Permutations  and   Permutation Groups"  of  the
reference manual.

\Section{Stabilizer chain records}

If a  permutation group  has a   stabilizer chain, this   is stored  as a
recursive structure. This  structure  is itself  a record~<S>  and it has
(1)~components that provide information about  one level~$G^{(i)}$ of the
stabilizer chain (which  we call  the  ``current stabilizer'')  and (2)~a
component `stabilizer'  that  holds   another such  record,   namely  the
stabilizer chain  of    the next stabilizer~$G^{(i+1)}$.  This  gives   a
recursive  structure  where the  ``outermost''  record  representing  the
``topmost'' stabilizer is bound to the group record component `stabChain'
and   has the components explained below.    Note: Since the structure is
recursive, *never print a stabilizer chain!* (Unless you want to exercise
the scrolling capabilities of your terminal.)
\beginitems
`identity' &
        the identity element of the current stabilizer.

`labels' &
        a list of permutations that serve as labels for the Schreier tree
        of  the current stabilizer,  i.e., as elements for the factorized
        inverse Schreier transversal.  The  first entry  is this list  is
        always the  `identity',    for  reasons explained   below   under
        `translabels'.  {\GAP}  tries  to  arrange   things so  that  the
        `labels' components are  identical (i.e., the same {\GAP} object)
        on every stabilizer of the chain;  this implies that the `labels'
        of   one stabilizer  do  not  necessarily   all lie  in the  next
        stabilizer (but see `genlabels' below).

`genlabels' &
        a list of integers that point to some  of the permutations in the
        `labels' component. The    `labels' addressed in this   way taken
        together form a generating set for the current stabilizer. If the
        `genlabels' component is empty,  the rest of the stabilizer chain
        represents  the trivial subgroup, and  can be ignored, e.g., when
        calculating the size.

`generators' &
        `labels\{ genlabels \}', but it can be a different set.

`orbit' &
        the vertices of  the Schreier tree,  which  form the basic  orbit
        $b_iG^{(i)}$, ordered in such a way that the  base point $b_i$ is
        first in the list.

`translabels' &
        the factorized inverse   transversal  that was  found during  the
        orbit  algorithm  carried out   with the   inverses of  `labels\{
        genlabels \}', starting from the base point. The directed edge
	$i(g)j  = ig^{-1}$ in  the Schreier tree  is represented by
        `labels[ translabels[<j>] ]' = <g> in  the stabilizer chain (note
        that <i> can be reconstructed as <jg> from this information). The
        entries in the `translabels'   component are thus   just integers
        giving the  positions of the appropriate   labels in the `labels'
        component. The base point itself (i.e.,  the root of the Schreier
        tree) has the entry `1' in  `translabels'. This makes it possible
        to assign `transversal\{ orbit \} := labels\{ translabels\{ orbit
        \} \}' (see  "ref:sublist!assignment" in the reference manual and
        `transversal'  below).   The `translabels'   component   pays off
        handsomely   in    the   stabilizer    chain   conjugation   (see
        "ref:ConjugateGroup!for permutation      groups" in the reference
        manual).

`transversal' &
        is another  representation of the factorized inverse transversal:
        as a list   with `transversal[<j>] =  labels[ translabels[<j>] ]'
        (the base point  itself has entry `()').  To look up  an entry in
        this list is faster than to evaluate  the expression on the right
        hand side,  and   since this operation   appears  most  often  in
        permutation   group     code    (e.g.,    in      the    function
        `InverseRepresentative' below), the speed-up is really worth this
        extra record component.

`stabilizer' &
        If  the  current stabilizer is  not   yet the trivial  group, the
        stabilizer chain continues with   the stabilizer of  the  current
        base  point,  which is    again  represented as  a   record  with
        components `labels',    `identity',    `genlabels', `generators',
        `orbit',     `translabels',  `transversal'     (and      possibly
        `stabilizer'). This record is bound to the `stabilizer' component
        of the current stabilizer. The last member  of a stabilizer chain
        is recognized  by the fact that  it has no `stabilizer' component
        bound.
\enditems
It is possible that different stabilizer  chains share the same record as
one of their iterated `stabilizer' components.  Note that the `stabChain'
record and `stabilizer'  records further down   are not themselves  group
records. Thus you cannot take such a record and  apply group functions to
it. Instead, the following functions can be used to access these records.
Let <S> denote a stabilizer chain.
\>IsFixedStabilizer( <S>, <pnt> )

returns `true'  if <pnt> is fixed by   all generators of  <S> and
`false' otherwise.

\>EmptyStabChain( <labels>, <id> \[, <pnt> \] )

constructs  a   stabilizer  chain  for   the trivial   group with
`identity=<id>' and `labels=$\{id\}\cup  labels$'  (but of course
with `genlabels=[ ]' and `generators=[ ]'). If the optional third
argument <pnt>  is present, the only stabilizer   of the chain is
initialized with the  one-point basic orbit  `[ <pnt> ]' and with
`translabels' and `transversal' components.

\>InsertTrivialStabilizer( <S>, <pnt> )

`InsertTrivialStabilizer' initializes the current stabilizer with
<pnt>  as `EmptyStabChain' did,  but  assigns the original <S> to
the  new `<S>.stabilizer' component,  such that  a new level with
trivial basic  orbit (but identical  `labels' and `ShallowCopy'ed
`genlabels' and  `generators') is  inserted. These functions  are
recommended if <pnt> really is  fixed  by the generators of  <S>,
because   then new generators  can   be added and  the  orbit and
transversal   at the  same   time  extended  with  the  following
function.

\>AddGeneratorsExtendSchreierTree( <S>, <new> )

adds the elements  in <new> to the list  of generators of <S> and
at the  same time extends the  orbit and transversal. This is the
only legal way  to extend  a  Schreier tree (because  it involves
careful handling of the tree components).

\>InverseRepresentative( <S>, <pnt> )

calculates the transversal element which  maps <pnt> back to  the
base point of  <S>. It just  runs back through the  Schreier tree
from <pnt> to the root and multiplies the labels along the way.

\>SiftedPermutation( <S>, <g> )

sifts  the element  <g> as  follows: <g>  is replaced by  `<g> \*
InverseRepresentative(  <S>, <S>.orbit[1] ^   <g> )', then <S> is
replaced by `<S>.stabilizer' and  this process is repeated  until
<S> is trivial or `<S>.orbit[1] ^ <g>' is  not in the basic orbit
`<S>.orbit'.  The remainder <g>  is returned, it  is the identity
permutation if  and  only if the  original <g>  was in  the group
described by the original~<S>.

\>GroupStabChain( \[ <G>, \] <S> )

constructs a permutation group with stabilizer chain <S>, i.e., a
group    with  generators `Generators( <S>  )'   to  which <S> is
assigned as component  `stabChain'. If the  optional argument <G>
is  given, the result  will be  a subgroup (in  the {\GAP} sense)
of~<G>.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Generalized conjugation technique}

The  command  `ConjugateGroup( <G>,  <p>  )' (see~"ref:ConjugateGroup!for
permutation groups" in the reference  manual) for a permutation group <G>
with  stabilizer chain equips its  result  also with  a stabilizer chain,
namely with the  chain of <G>  conjugate by <p>. Conjugating a stabilizer
chain by a permutation <p> means replacing all the points which appear in
the `orbit' components  by their  images  under <p>  and replacing  every
permutation <g> which appears in a `labels' or `transversal' component by
its  conjugate $g^p$. The conjugate   $g^p$  acts  on the mapped   points
exactly  as  <g>  did  on  the original points,    i.e.,  $(pnt.p). g^p =
(pnt.g).p$.  Since  the  entries   in  the  `translabels' components  are
integers pointing to  positions  of the `labels' list,  the `translabels'
lists just have to be permuted by <p> for the conjugated stabilizer. Then
`generators' is  reconstructed     as   `labels\{ genlabels   \}'     and
`transversal\{ orbit \}' as `labels\{ translabels\{ orbit \} \}'.

This    conjugation technique    can be    generalized.\index{generalized
conjugation technique}  Instead of mapping  points and permutations under
the same permutation <p>, it is sometimes desirable (e.g., in the context
of permutation  group homomorphisms) to  map the points with an arbitrary
mapping <map>  and the permutations with  a homomorphism <hom>  such that
the  compatibility  of the actions is  still   valid: $map(pnt). hom(g) =
map(pnt.g)$. (Of course   the ordinary conjugation is  a  special case of
this, with $map(pnt) = pnt.p$ and $hom(g) = g^p$.)

In   the generalized  case,  the  ``conjugated''  chain  need  not   be a
stabilizer chain for the image  of <hom>, since  the ``preimage'' of  the
stabilizer of $map(b)$ (where <b> is a base point) need  not fix <b>, but
only fixes the  preimage $map^{-1}(map(b))$ setwise. Therefore the method
can be applied only to one level and the next stabilizer must be computed
explicitly. But if <map> is injective, we have $map(b).hom(g)=map(b) \iff
b.g=b$, and  if this holds, then  $g=w(g_1,\ldots,g_n)$ is  a word in the
generators  $g_1,\ldots,g_n$ of  the   stabilizer   of~<b>  and   $hom(g)
\buildrel\*\over =  w(hom(g_1),\ldots,hom(g_n))$ is in the ``conjugated''
stabilizer. If,     more generally,  <hom>   is a   right inverse   to  a
homomorphism~$\varphi$     (i.e.,    $\varphi(hom(g))=g\,\forall     g$),
equality~$\*$ holds modulo   ${\rm   Ker}\,\varphi$; in this   case   the
``conjugated'' chain    can be  made  into  a  real  stabilizer  chain by
extending  each  level  with   the  generators ${\rm   Ker}\,\varphi$ and
appending a proper stabilizer chain  of~${\rm Ker}\,\varphi$ at the  end.
These special cases will occur   in the algorithms for permutation  group
homomorphisms  (see~"ref:Homomorphisms!for     permutation groups" in the
reference manual).

To ``conjugate''  the  points  (i.e., `orbit')  and  permutations  (i.e.,
`labels') of the Schreier  tree, a loop is  set up over the `orbit'  list
constructed  during the  orbit algorithm,  and for each  vertex  <b> with
unique edge $a(l)b$ ending at  <b>, the label  <l> is mapped with
<hom> and <b> with   <map>. We assume  that  the `orbit' list   was built
w.r.t.~a  certain ordering of the  labels, where $l'\<l$ means that every
point in the  orbit was mapped with  $l'$ before it  was mapped with <l>.
This shape of the  `orbit'  list is guaranteed if   the Schreier tree  is
extended only by  `AddGeneratorsExtendSchreierTree', and it  is then also
guaranteed  for the ``conjugated''  Schreier  tree. (The  ordering of the
labels cannot be read from the Schreier tree, however.)

In the generalized case, it   can happen that the   edge $a(l)b$
bears a label <l> whose image is ``old'', i.e.,  equal to the image of an
earlier label  $l'\<l$. Because of  the  compatibility of the  actions we
then have   $map(b)    = map(a).  hom(l)^{-1}   =   map(a).hom(l')^{-1} =
map(a{l'}^{-1})$, so $map(b)$ is already equal to the image of the vertex
$a{l'}^{-1}$. This vertex must have been encountered before $b = al^{-1}$
because $l'\<l$. We  conclude that the image of   a label can  be ``old''
only if the vertex at  the end of  the corresponding edge has an  ``old''
image,  too, but then  it need  not be  ``conjugated''  at all. A similar
remark applies to labels which map under <hom> to the identity.

\Section{The general backtrack algorithm with ordered partitions}

\begingroup%
\def\R{{\cal R}} \def\I{{\cal I}}%

Section "ref:Backtrack searching" in the reference manual describes how a
backtrack search can be organized with ordered partitions. The purpose of
this section  is  to document  how  the general   backtrack algorithm  is
implemented in {\GAP} and which  parts you have to modify  if you want to
write your own backtrack routines.

\medskip
\atindex{ordered partitions!internal representation}{|indexit}%
{\bsf   Internal   representation  of  ordered  partitions.}\quad  {\GAP}
represents an   ordered   partition  as a  record    with   the following
components.
\beginitems
`points' &
        a list  of all points contained in  the  partition, such that the
        points of each cell from lie consecutively,

`cellno' &
        a list whose <i>th entry is the number of the cell which contains
        the point <i>,

`firsts' &
        a list  such that  `points[firsts[<j>]]'  is  the first point  in
        `points' which is in cell <j>,

`lengths' &
        a list of the  cell lengths.
\enditems
Some of the information is  redundant, e.g., the  `lengths' could also be
read off the `firsts' list,  but since this   need not be increasing,  it
would    require some searching. Similar  for    `cellno', which could be
replaced by a systematic search  of `points', keeping  track of what cell
is currently being  traversed. With the above  components, the <m>th cell
of   a partition <P> is   expressed as `<P>.points{  [ <P>.firsts[<m>] ..
<P>.firsts[<m>] +  <P>.lengths[<m>]  -  1  ]   }'. The   most   important
operations, however, to be performed upon <P> are the splitting of a cell
and the reuniting  of the two parts. Following  the strategy  of J.~Leon,
this is done as follows:

(1) The points which make up the cell that  is to be  split are sorted so
that the ones  that remain inside occupy  positions `[ <P>.firsts[<m>] ..
<last> ]' in the list `<P>.points' (for a suitable value of <last>).

(2) The  points   at positions  `[   <last>  + 1 ..    <P>.firsts[<m>]  +
<P>.lengths[<m>] - 1 ]' will form the  additional cell. For this new cell
requires additional entries are  added to the lists `<P>.firsts' (namely,
`<last>+1')     and    `<P>.lengths'   (namely,      `<P>.firsts[<m>]   +
<P>.lengths[<m>] - <last> - 1').

(3) The entries of the sublist `<P>.cellno{ [ <last>+1 .. <P>.firsts[<m>]
+ P.lengths[<m>]-1 ] }' must be set to the number of the new cell.

(4) The entry    `<P>.lengths[<m>]'  must   be  reduced  to   `<last>   -
<P>.firsts[<m>] + 1'.

Then reuniting the  two cells requires  only the reversal of steps~2 to~4
above. The list `<P>.points' need not be rearranged.

\medskip
{\bsf Functions for setting up  an R-base.}\quad This subsection explains
some  {\GAP}    functions  which   are  local  to    the    library  file
``lib/stbcbckt.gi'' which    contains   the code for      backtracking in
permutation groups.  They are mentioned here  because you might find them
helpful when you want to implement you own backtracking function based on
the partition concept. An important argument  to most of the functions is
the R-base $\R$, which you should regard as a black box. We will tell you
how to  set it up,  how to maintain it and  where to pass it as argument,
but  it is not  necessary  for you  to know its  internal representation.
However,  if you insist to  learn  the whole  story:  Here are the record
components from which an R-base is made up:
\beginitems
`domain' &
    the set $\Omega$ on which the group $G$ operates

`base' &
    the sequence $(a_1,\ldots,a_r)$ of base points

`partition' &
    an  ordered  partition, initially  $\Pi_0$, this  will be  refined to
    $\Pi_1,\ldots,\Pi_r$ during the backtrack algorithm

`where' &
    a list such that $a_i$ lies in cell number `where[ $i$ ]' of $\Pi_i$

`rfm' &
    a    list whose $i$th entry  is   a  list of   refinements which take
    $\Sigma_i$  to $\Sigma_{i+1}$;  the    structure of a  refinement  is
    described below

`chain' &
    a (copy of a) stabilizer  chain for $G$ (not  if  $G$ is a  symmetric
    group)

`fix' &
    only if  $G$ is a  symmetric group:  a list whose  $i$ entry contains
    `Fixcells( $\Pi_i$ )'

`level' &
    initially equal to `chain',  this will be changed  to chains  for the
    stabilizers  $G_{a_1\dots  a_i}$    for  $i=1,\ldots,r$  during   the
    backtrack algorithm; if $G$ is a  symmetric group, only the number of
    moved points is stored for each stabilizer

`lev' &
    a  list   whose  $i$th  entry   remembers   the  `level' entry    for
    $G_{a_1\ldots a_{i-1}}$

`level2', `lev2' &
    a similar  construction   for a second  group  (used  in intersection
    calculations), `false' otherwise.  This second group $H$ activated if
    the R-base  is constructed as  `EmptyRBase(  [ $G$, $H$  ], $\Omega$,
    $\Pi_0$ )' (if `$G$ = $H$', {\GAP} sets `level2 = true' instead).

`nextLevel' &
    this is described below
\enditems

As  our guiding example, we  present  code for the function `Centralizer'
which calculates the centralizer of an element $g$ in the group $G$. (The
real code is more general and has a few more subtleties.)

1.\enspace $\Omega$ is the set on which $G$ acts and $\Pi_0$ is the first
member   of   the  decreasing   sequence   of  partitions    mentioned in
"ref:Backtrack  searching"     in    the  reference   manual.    We   set
$\Pi_0=(\Omega)$,  which is  constructed  as `TrivialPartition(  $\Omega$
)'), but we could have started with  a finer partition, e.g., into unions
of $g$-cycles of the same length.

2.\enspace This statement sets up the R-base in the variable $\R$.

3--21.\enspace These lines define  a  function `$\R$.nextLevel' which  is
called  whenever an  additional member in   the sequence $\Pi_0 \ge \Pi_1
\ge\ldots$ of   partitions is needed.  If  $\Pi_i$ does   not yet contain
enough base points in one-point  cells, {\GAP} will call `$\R$.nextLevel(
$\Pi_i$, $\R$  )',  and this  function   will choose   a  new base  point
$a_{i+1}$, refine $\Pi_i$  to  $\Pi_{i+1}$ (thereby *changing*  the first
argument) and store all necessary information in~$\R$.

5.\enspace  This statement selects a new   base point $a_{i+1}$, which is
not yet  in a one-point  cell of $\Pi$ and still  moved by the stabilizer
$G_{a_1\ldots a_i}$  of the  earlier base points.   If certain points  of
$\Omega$ should are preferred as base point (e.g., because they belong to
long cycles of $g$), a list of points starting with the most wanted ones,
can  be given as optional  third  argument to `NextRBasePoint' (actually,
this is done in the real code for `Centralizer').

6.\enspace  `Fixcells( $\Pi$ )' returns the  list of  points in one-point
cells of $\Pi$ (ordered as the cells are ordered in $\Pi$).

7.\enspace For every point $p\in fix$,  if we know the  image `$p$ ^ $g$'
under $c\in C_G(e)$, we also know `( $p$ ^ $g$ ) ^ $c$ = (  $p$ ^ $c$ ) ^
$g$'. We therefore want to isolate these extra points in $\Pi$.

9.\enspace This statement puts point $q$ in a cell  of its own, returning
in $where$ the number of the cell  of $\Pi$ from  which $q$ was taken. If
$q$ was already the only point in its cell, `$where$ = false' instead.

12.\enspace This  command does the   necessary bookkeeping for  the extra
base point $q$:  It prescribes $q$ as next  base in the  stabilizer chain
for $G$ (needed, e.g., in line~5) and  returns `false' if $q$ was already
fixed the  stabilizer of the  earlier base points (and  `true' otherwise;
this is not used here).  Another call to  `ProcessFixpoint' like this was
impicitly  made by the  function  `NextRBasePoint' to register the chosen
base  point. By contrast,  the  point $q$  was  not chosen  this  way, so
`ProcessFixpoint' must be called explicitly for~$q$.

13.\enspace  This statement registers  the   function which will be  used
during the  backtrack search to perform  the corresponding refinements on
the ``image partition'' $\Sigma_i$ (to yield the refined $\Sigma_{i+1}$).
After choosing an image  $b_{i+1}$ for the  base point $a_{i+1}$,  {\GAP}
will compute $\Sigma_i \wedge (\{b_{i+1}\},\Omega-\{b_{i+1}\})$ and store
this partition in `$\I$.partition', where $\I$  is a black box similar to
$\R$, but  corresponding to the current  ``image partition'' (hence it is
an   ``R-image'' in analogy  to the  R-base). Then {\GAP}   will call the
function `Refinements.Centralizer( $\R$, $\I$,  $\Pi$.cellno[ $p$ ], $p$,
$where$  )',  with the  then current values  of $\R$  and $\I$, but where
`$\Pi$.cellno[ $p$ ]',  $p$, $where$ still  have the values they  have at
the time of this `AddRefinement' command. This function call will further
refine  `$\I$.partition' to yield $\Sigma_{i+1}$ as  it  is programmed in
the function `Refinements.Centralizer',  which  is described  below. (The
global  variable `Refinements' is  a record which contains all refinement
functions for all backtracking procedures.)

14--18.\enspace If  the cell from which  $q$ was taken  out  had only two
points, we   now have an   additional one-point  cell. This  condition is
checked  in line~13 and if it  is true, this  extra fixpoint $p$ is taken
(line~15), processed like $q$  before   (line~16) and is then   (line~17)
passed to another refinement function `Refinements.ProcessFixpoint( $\R$,
$\I$, $p$, $where$ )', which is also described below.

22--27.\enspace This command starts the backtrack search. Its result will
be the centralizer as a subgroup of $G$. Its arguments are
\beginlist
  \item{22.} the group we want to run through,
  \item{23.} the property we want to test, as a {\GAP} function,
  \item{24.} `false' if we are looking for a subgroup, `true' in the case
    of   a  representative  search    (when  the result   would    be one
    representative),
  \item{25.} the R-base,
  \item{26.} a list  of data, to be stored  in `$\I$.data', which has
    in position~1 the first member $\Sigma_0$  of the decreasing sequence
    of ``image partitions'' mentioned in "ref:Backtrack searching" in the
    reference manual. In the centralizer example, position~2 contains the
    element that is  to be centralized. In the  case of  a representative
    search,  i.e.,  a conjugacy test  `$g$  ^ $c \buildrel?\over= h$', we
    would  have $h$   instead of  $g$   here, and   possibly a $\Sigma_0$
    different from $\Pi_0$ (e.g., a  partition into unions of  $h$=cycles
    of same length).
  \item{27.} two subgroups  $L\le  C_G(g)$  and  $R\le  C_G(h)$ known  in
    advance (we have $L=R$ in the centralizer case).

{\bsf Refinement  functions   for the  backtrack  search.}\quad  The last
subsection showed   how the refinement   process leading from  $\Pi_i$ to
$\Pi_{i+1}$  is coded in the  function  `$\R$.nextLevel', this  has to be
executed once the  base point  $a_{i+1}$.  The analogous refinement  step
from $\Sigma_i$ to $\Sigma_{i+1}$ must be performed for each choice of an
image $b_{i+1}$ for  $a_{i+1}$, and it will  depend  on the corresponding
value of $\Sigma_i\wedge  (\{b_{i+1}\}, \Omega-\{b_{i+1}\})$. But  before
we  can continue  our centralizer example,  we  must,  for the interested
reader, document the record components of the other black box $\I$, as we
did above for the R-base black box $\R$. Most of the components change as
{\GAP} walks up and down the levels of the search tree.
\beginitems
`data' &
    this will be mentioned below

`depth' &
    the level $i$ in the search tree of the current node $\Sigma_i$

`bimg' &
    a list of images of the points in `$\R$.base'

`partition' &
    the partition $\Sigma_i$ of the current node

`level' &
    the stabilizer chain `$\R$.lev[ $i$ ]' at the current level

`perm' &
    a permutation mapping `Fixcells(  $\Pi_i$ )' to `Fixcells( $\Sigma_i$
    )' (this implies mapping $(a_1,\ldots,a_i)$ to $(b_1,\ldots,b_i)$)

`level2', `perm2' &
    a  similar construction for    the second stabilizer chain,   `false'
    otherwise (and `true' if `$\R$.level2 = true')
\enditems

As declared in    the above code  for  `Centralizer',  the refinement  is
performed   by   the function     `Refinement.Centralizer(   $\R$,  $\I$,
$\Pi$.cellno[  $p$  ],  $p$,  $where$ )'.   The  functions in the  record
`Refinement' always   take two  additional   arguments  before  the  ones
specified  in  the `AddRefinement'  call (in  line~13 above),  namely the
R-base  $\R$ and  the  current  value  $\I$  of the ``R-image''.   In our
example,  $p$   is a   fixpoint  of   $\Pi= \Pi_i   \wedge  (\{a_{i+1}\},
\Omega-\{a_{i+1}\})$ such that `$where$ = $\Pi$.cellno[ $p$ ^ $g$ ]'. The
`Refinement'   functions   must  return `false'    if   the refinement is
unsuccessful (e.g., because it  leads to $\Sigma_{i+1}$ having  different
cell   sizes from  $\Pi_{i+1}$)  and  `true'  otherwise.   Our particular
function looks like this.

3.\enspace    The  current    value   of   $\Sigma_i\wedge  (\{b_{i+1}\},
\Omega-\{b_{i+1}\})$ is always found in `$\I$.partition'.

4.\enspace  The image of  the  only  point  in  cell number  `$cellno$  =
$\Pi_i$.cellno[ $p$  ]' in $\Sigma$  under `$g$ = $\I$.data[ 2 ]' is
calculated.

5.\enspace The function returns `true' only if the image $q$ has the same
cell number in $\Sigma$ as  $p$ had in  $\Pi$ (i.e., $where$) and if  $q$
can be prescribed as  an image for $p$  under the coset of the stabilizer
$G_{a_1\ldots a_{i+1}}.c$ where $c\in    G$ is an  (already  constructed)
element  mapping the earlier  base   points $a_1,\ldots,a_{i+1}$ to   the
already  chosen  images $b_1,\ldots,b_{i+1}$.  This  latter condition  is
tested by `ProcessFixpoint( $\I$, $p$,  $q$ )' which, if successful, also
does the  necessary bookkeeping in $\I$. In  analogy to  the remark about
line~12 in  the program above, the   chosen image $b_{i+1}$  for the base
point $a_{i+1}$ has  already  been processed implicitly by  the  function
`PartitionBacktrack', and this processing includes the construction of an
element  $c\in G$ which    maps   `Fixcells( $\Pi_i$  )'  to   `Fixcells(
$\Sigma_i$  )'  and  $a_{i+1}$   to $b_{i+1}$.  By  contrast,   the extra
fixpoints $p$  and $q$ in  $\Pi_{i+1}$ and $\Sigma_{i+1}$ were not chosen
automatically,   so they require an  explicit  call of `ProcessFixpoint',
which replaces the element  $c$ by some  $c'.c$ (with $c'\in G_{a_1\ldots
a_{i+1}}$) which in addition maps $p$ to  $q$, or returns `false' if this
is impossible.

You should now be able to  guess what `Refinements.ProcessFixpoint( $\R$,
$\I$, $p$, $where$   )' does: it  simply returns  `ProcessFixpoint( $\I$,
$p$, FixpointCellNo( $\I$.partition, $where$ ) )'.

\medskip
{\bsf  Summary.}\quad When you write  your  own backtrack functions using
the  partition technique,  you  have  to  supply  an R-base, including  a
component `nextLevel', and   the  functions in the   `Refinements' record
which  you need. Then  you can start  the backtrack by passing the R-base
and the additional data (for the  `data' component of the ``R-image'') to
`PartitionBacktrack'.

\medskip
{\bsf  Functions  for  meeting    ordered  partitions.}\quad A   kind  of
refinement that   occurs  in particular  in   the  normalizer calculation
involves computing  the  meet of $\Pi$  (cf.\ lines~6ff.\  above) with an
arbitary other partition  $\Lambda$, not just  with one point. To do this
efficiently, {\GAP} uses the following two functions.

\>StratMeetPartition( $\R$, $\Pi$, $\Lambda$ \[, $g$ \] )
\>MeetPartitionStrat( $\R$, $\I$, {$\Lambda'$} \[, {$g'$} \], $strat$ )

\index{meet strategy}%
Such a  `StratMeetPartition'   command would   typically appear in    the
function call `$\R$.nextLevel(  $\Pi$, $\R$ )'  (during the refinement of
$\Pi_i$  to  $\Pi_{i+1}$). This   command  replaces  $\Pi$  by $\Pi\wedge
\Lambda$ (thereby  *changing* the  second  argument) and retuns  a ``meet
strategy''  $strat$. This  is  (for  us) a  black   box which  serves two
purposes:  First, it allows {\GAP} to  calculate faster the corresponding
meet $\Sigma\wedge \Lambda'$,  which must then  appear in a `Refinements'
function  (during the refinement of  $\Sigma_i$ to $\Sigma_{i+1}$). It is
faster  to compute $\Sigma\wedge \Lambda'$ with  the ``meet strategy'' of
$\Pi\wedge \Lambda$ because  if the refinement  of $\Sigma$ is successful
at  all, the  intersection  of a  cell from   the left hand  side of  the
$\wedge$ sign  with a cell  from the right hand side  must  have the same
size   in both cases  (and  $strat$  records these   sizes, so  that only
non-empty intersections must  be calculated for $\Sigma\wedge \Lambda'$).
Second, if  there  is a discrepancy  between  the behaviour prescribed by
$strat$ and the behaviour observed when refining $\Sigma$, the refinement
can immediately be abandoned.

On  the  other hand, if you  only  want to meet   a  partition $\Pi$ with
$\Lambda$  for  a one-time  use, without recording   a strategy,  you can
simply type `StratMeetPartition( $\Pi$, $\Lambda$ )'  as in the following
example, which also demonstrates some other partition-related commands.
\beginexample
    gap> P := Partition( [[1,2],[3,4,5],[6]] );;  Cells( P );
    [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4, 5 ], [ 6 ] ]
    gap> Q := OnPartitions( P, (1,3,6) );;  Cells( Q );
    [ [ 3, 2 ], [ 6, 4, 5 ], [ 1 ] ]
    gap> StratMeetPartition( P, Q );
    [  ]  # the ``meet strategy'' was not recorded, ignore this result
    gap> Cells( P );
    [ [ 1 ], [ 5, 4 ], [ 6 ], [ 2 ], [ 3 ] ]
\endexample
You can even say  `StratMeetPartition( $\Pi$, $\Delta$ )'  where $\Delta$
is simple  a subset  of  $\Omega$, it   will then  be interpreted as  the
partition $(\Delta,\Omega-\Delta)$.

{\GAP} makes use   of  the advantages  of   a ``meet  strategy''  if  the
refinement   function  in `Refinements'  contains  a `MeetPartitionStrat'
command where   $strat$  is   the    ``meet  strategy''  calculated    by
`StratMeetPartition' before.  Such a command replaces `$\I$.partition' by
its meet with $\Lambda'$, again changing the argument $\I$. The necessary
reversal of these changes when backtracking from  a node (and prescribing
the next possible image  for a base point) is  automatically done by  the
function `PartitionBacktrack'.

In  all cases, an additional  argument $g$ means that the   meet is to be
taken  not with $\Lambda$,   but  instead with $\Lambda.{g^{-1}}$,  where
operation  on ordered partitions is  meant cellwise  (and setwise on each
cell). (Analogously for the primed arguments.)
\beginexample
    gap> P := Partition( [[1,2],[3,4,5],[6]] );;
    gap> StratMeetPartition( P, P, (1,6,3) );;  Cells( P );
    [ [ 1 ], [ 5, 4 ], [ 6 ], [ 2 ], [ 3 ] ]  # |$P.(1,3,6) = Q|$
\endexample

\medskip
{\bsf Avoiding multiplication  of permutations.}\quad In the  description
of  the last subsections, the  backtrack  algorithm constructs an element
$c\in G$ mapping  the base points   to the prescribed images  and finally
tests the property in question for that element. During the construction,
$c$ is obtained as a product  of transversal elements from the stabilizer
chain for $G$,  and so multiplications  of permutations are required  for
every $c$  submitted to the test,  even if the  test fails (i.e.,  in our
centralizer example, if `$g$ ^ $c$ \<> $g$'). Even if the construction of
$c$ stops before images  for all base  points have been chosen, because a
refinement was unsuccessful,  several  multiplications will  already have
been performed by (explicit or implicit) calls of `ProcessFixpoint', and,
actually, the general   backtrack procedure implemented in  {\GAP} avoids
this.

For this purpose, {\GAP} does  not actually multiply the permutations but
rather stores  all the factors of the   product in a  list. Specifically,
instead of carrying out  the multiplication in $c\mapsto c'.c$  mentioned
in  the   comment  to  line~5 of  the   above  program   --- where $c'\in
G_{a_1\ldots  a_{i+1}}$ is a  product  of factorized inverse  transversal
elements, see "Stabilizer  chain records" ---  {\GAP} appends the list of
these factorized inverse  transversal elements (giving  $c'$) to the list
of factors already  collected for $c$. Here $c'$  is multiplied from  the
left and is itself a  product of *inverses*  of strong generators of $G$,
but {\GAP} simply spares itself   all the work of inverting  permutations
and stores  only  a    ``list  of  inverses'',  whose product    is  then
$(c'.c)^{-1}$  (which is  the  new  value of  $c^{-1}$).  The ``list   of
inverses'' is  extended this way  whenever `ProcessFixpoint' is called to
improve~$c$.

The  product has to be multiplied  out only when  the property is finally
tested  for  the  element $c$. But  it  is  often possible  to  delay the
multiplication  even  futher, namely  until after   the test, so  that no
multiplication is required in the case of  an unsuccessful test. Then the
test  itself  must be carried   out with the  factorized   version of the
element $c$.  For  this purpose,  `PartitionBacktrack' can  be passed its
second argument (the property  in question) in  a different way, not as a
single {\GAP} function, but as a list like in lines 2--4 of the following
alternative excerpt from the code for `Centralizer'.

{\newcount\lineno%

\)\quad false, $\R$, [ $\Pi_0$, $g$ ], $L$, $R$ );
  \vadjust{\allowbreak}%

}%
The test for $c$ to have the property in question  is of the form `$opr$(
$left$,  $c$  )  =  $right$' where  $opr$   is an  operation  function as
explained in "ref:External sets" in the reference manual. In other words,
$c$ passes the test if and only if it maps a ``left object'' to a ``right
object'' under  a certain operation. In  the centralizer example, we have
`$opr$ =  OnPoints' and $left = right  = g$, but  in a conjugacy test, we
would have $right = h$.

2.\enspace  Two first two  entries (here $g$ and  $g$)  are the values of
$left$ and $right$.

3.\enspace The third entry (here `OnPoints') is the operation $opr$.

4.\enspace The fourth  entry is the test to  be performed upon the mapped
left object $left$  and preimage  of  the right object `$opr$(   $right$,
$c$^-1 )'.  Here {\GAP} operates with the  inverse of $c$ because this is
the product of  the permutations stored  in the ``list of inverses''. The
preimage of $right$ under $c$ is then calculcated by mapping $right$ with
the factors  of $c^{-1}$ one by one,  without the need  to multiply these
factors.    This mapping  of  $right$  is     automatically done by   the
`ProcessFixpoint' function whenever $c$ is extended, the current value of
$right$ is always  stored  in `$c$!.rgtObj'.  When the test  given by the
fourth entry  is finally performed,   the element $c$  has two components
`$c$!.lftObj =  $left$' and `$c$!.rgtObj  =   $opr$( $right$, $c$^-1  )',
which must be used to express the desired  relation as a function of $c$.
In our  centralizer  example, we simply  have  to test   whether they are
equal.

\Section{Stabilizer chains for automorphisms acting on enumerators}\null

In this section  we present an example in  which objects we  already know
(namely,  automorphisms  of   solvable  groups)   are  equipped  with the
permutation-like operations `^' and `/'  for action on positive integers.
To achieve this, we must  define a new  type of objects which behave like
permutations   but are  represented     as automorphisms  acting  on   an
enumerator.  Our  goal is to  generalize  the Schreier-Sims algorithm for
construction of a stabilizer chain to groups of such new automorphisms.

{\bsf  An operation domain for automorphisms.}\quad  The idea we describe
here is due  to C.~Sims. We consider  a group $A$  of  automorphisms of a
group $G$, given by generators,  and we would like  to know its order. Of
course we  could   follow the strategy  of  the   Schreier-Sims algorithm
(described  in "ref:Stabilizer chains"  in  the reference manual) for $A$
acting   on   $G$. This would    involve   a  call  of  `StabChainStrong(
EmptyStabChain( [   ],  One( $A$ ) ),   GroupGenerators(  $A$ ) )'  where
`StabChainStrong'  is a function as the  one described in the pseudo-code
below:

\)StabChainStrong := function( $S$, $newgens$ )
\)\quad{\rm Extend the Schreier tree of $S$ with $newgens$.}
\)\quad for $sch$  in {\rm Schreier generators}  do
\)\qquad if $sch \notin S$.stabilizer  then
\)\qquad\quad StabChainStrong( $S$.stabilizer, [ $sch$ ] );
\)\qquad fi;
\)\quad od;
\)end;
  \vadjust{\allowbreak}%

The membership test `$sch  \notin S$.stabilizer' can be performed because
the  stabilizer chain  of `$S$.stabilizer'  is   already correct at  that
moment. We  even know a base  in advance, namely  any  generating set for
$G$. Fix such  a generating set  $(g_1,\ldots,g_d)$ and observe that this
base  is  generally very   short compared  to   the degree $|G|$  of  the
operation. The problem with the Schreier-Sims algorithm, however, is then
that the length of the first  basic orbit $g_1.A$  would already have the
magnitude of $|G|$,  and the basic orbits at  deeper levels would  not be
much shorter. For the advantage of a short base  we pay the high price of
long basic  orbits, since the  product of  the  (few) basic orbit lengths
must  equal $|A|$.  Such  long  orbits  make the Schreier-Sims  algorithm
infeasible,   so we have to   look for a  longer base  with shorter basic
orbits.

Assume that   $G$ is solvable  and  choose  a  characteristic series with
elementary abelian factors. For the sake of  simplicity we assume that $N
\< G$ is an   elementary abelian characteristic subgroup  with elementary
abelian factor group $G/N$. Since $N$ is characteristic, $A$ also acts as
a group of automorphisms  on the factor  group $G/N$,  but of course  not
necessarily  faithfully. To retain  a faithful action,  we let $A$ act on
the disjoint  union  $G/N   \mathbin{\dot\cup} G$  and  choose  as   base
$(g_1N,\ldots,g_dN,g_1,\ldots,g_d)$.  Now the first  $d$ basic orbits lie
inside $G/N$ and can have length at  most $[G\mathbin:N]$. Since the base
points  $g_1N,\ldots,  g_dN$  form a  generating   set  for  $G/N$, their
iterated stabilizer $A^{(d+1)}$ acts trivially on the factor group $G/N$,
i.e., it leaves  the cosets $g_iN$  invariant. Accordingly,  the next $d$
basic orbits lie inside  $g_iN$ (for $i=1,\ldots,d$)  and can have length
at most~$|N|$.

Generalizing this method to a characteristic series $G=N_0 > N_1 > \ldots
> N_l=\{1\}$ of length $l>2$, we  can always find  a base of length $l.d$
such that each  basic orbit is  contained in a  coset of a characteristic
factor, i.e. in a set of the form $g_iN_{j-1}/N_j$ (where $g_i$ is one of
the generators  of $G$ and $1\le j\le  l$). In particular, the  length of
the basic  orbits   is  bounded   by  the  size  of    the  corresponding
characteristic factors. To implement a Schreier-Sims algorithm for such a
base, we  must  be   able  to  let   automorphisms  act  on   cosets   of
characteristic  factors $g_iN_{j-1}/N_j$, for  varying  $i$  and $j$.  We
would    like to    translate each such     action  into  an  action   on
$\{1,\ldots,[N_{j-1}\mathbin: N_j]\}$, because then we need not enumerate
the operation domain
$$
   G/N_1 \mathbin{\dot\cup} G/N_2 \mathbin{\dot\cup} \ldots
         \mathbin{\dot\cup} G/N_l $$
as a whole. Enumerating it  as a whole would result  in basic orbits like
$`orbit'\subseteq \{1001,\ldots,1100\}$  with a  `transversal' list whose
first 1000 entries would be unbound, but  still require 4~bytes of memory
each (see~"Stabilizer chain records").

Identifying   each  coset   $g_iN_{j-1}/N_j$ into   $\{1,\ldots, [N_{j-1}
\mathbin: N_j]\}$ of  course means that we have  to change the action  of
the automorphisms on     every  level of   the  stabilizer   chain.  Such
flexibility is not   possible with permutations  because their  effect on
positive  integers  is ``hardwired''  into them,  but  we can install new
operations for automorphisms.

{\bsf Enumerators for cosets of  characteristic factors.}\quad So far  we
have  not used the  fact that  the characteristic  factors are elementary
abelian, but we will do so from  here on. Our  first task is to implement
an enumerator (see "ref:AsList and  Enumerators" in the reference manual)
for a coset of a characteristic factor in a solvable group $G$. We assume
that such a coset $gN/M$ is given by
\beginlist
\item{(1)}  a pcgs for  the group  $G$ (see  "ref:Pcgs" in the  reference
  manual), let `$n$ = Length( $pcgs$ )';
\item{(2)} a range `$range$ = [ $start$  .. $stop$ ]' indicating that `$N
  =  \langle pcgs$\{ [ $start$  .. $n$ ] \} $\rangle$'  and `$M = \langle
  pcgs$\{  [  $stop$ + 1   .. $n$ ]  \} $\rangle$',  i.e.,  the cosets of
  `$pcgs$\{ $range$ \}' form a base for the vector space $N/M$;
\item{(3)} the representative $g$.
\endlist
We   first  define a  new representation  for   such enumerators and then
construct them by simply putting these three pieces of data into a record
object. The  enumerator  should  behave as  a   list of  group   elements
(representing cosets modulo $M$),   consequently, its family will  be the
family of the $pcgs$ itself.
\begintt
IsCosetSolvableFactorEnumeratorRep := NewRepresentation
    ( "isCosetSolvableFactorEnumerator", IsEnumerator,
                                [ "pcgs", "range", "representative" ] );

EnumeratorCosetSolvableFactor := function( pcgs, range, g )
    return Objectify( NewKind( FamilyObj( pcgs ),
                   IsCosetSolvableFactorEnumeratorRep ),
                   rec( pcgs := pcgs,
                       range := range,
              representative := g ) );
end;
\endtt
The definition of the operations `Length', `\\[\\]' and `Position' is now
straightforward. The  code has sometimes  been  abbreviated and is  meant
``cum grano salis'',  e.g.,  the declaration of  the local  variables has
been left out.

    for i  in Reversed( enum!.range )  do

        elm := enum!.pcgs[ i ] ^ ( pos mod p ) * elm;

                   LeftQuotient( enum!.representative, elm ) );
    pos := 0;
    for i  in enum!.range  do
        pos := pos * RelativeOrderOfPcElement( pcgs, i ) + exp[ i ];
    od;
    return pos + 1;
end );
\endtt

{\bsf  Making automorphisms act  on such enumerators.}\quad Our next task
is to make automorphisms of the  solvable group `$pcgs$!.group' act on `[
1 .. Length( $enum$ )  ]' for such an  enumerator $enum$. We achieve this
by  introducing a new  representation of automorphisms on enumerators and
by putting the enumerator together  with the automorphism into an  object
which behaves like  a permutation. Turning  an ordinary automorphism into
such  a special  automorphism requires  then   the construction of  a new
object which has the new kind. We provide an operation `PermOnEnumerator(
$model$, $aut$ )' which constructs such a new object having the same kind
as  $model$,  but representing the  automorphism  $aut$. So $aut$  can be
either an ordinary automorphism or one which already has an enumerator in
its kind, but perhaps  different from the one  we want (i.e. from the one
in $model$).

InstallMethod( PermOnEnumerator, true,
        [ IsEnumerator, IsPermOnEnumeratorDefaultRep ], 0,
    function( enum, a )
    a := Objectify( TypeObj( a ), rec( perm := a!.perm ) );
    SetEnumerator( a, enum );
    return a;
end );
\endtt
Next we  have to install new  methods for the  operations which calculate
the  product of two automorphisms, because   this product must again have
the    right kind. We    also have to write  a    function which uses the
enumerators to apply such an automorphism to positive integers.
\begintt
InstallMethod( \*, IsIdenticalObj,
        [ IsPermOnEnumeratorDefaultRep, IsPermOnEnumeratorDefaultRep ], 0,
    function( a, b )
    perm := a!.perm * b!.perm;
    SetIsBijective( perm, true );
    return PermOnEnumerator( Enumerator( a ), perm );
end );
\endtt

\begintt
InstallMethod( \^, true,
        [ IsPosRat and IsInt, IsPermOnEnumeratorDefaultRep ], 0,
    function( p, a )
    return PositionCanonical( Enumerator( a ),
                   Enumerator( a )[ p ] ^ a!.perm );
end );
\endtt
How the corresponding  methods for `$p$ /  $aut$' and `$aut$  ^ $n$' look
like is obvious.

Now we  can  formulate  the recursive procedure   `StabChainStrong' which
extends  the stabilizer chain by adding  in new  generators $newgens$. We
content  ourselves again   with pseudo-code, emphasizing  only  the lines
which set the `EnumeratorDomainPermutation'. We assume that initially $S$
is a stabilizer chain for the trivial subgroup with a level for each pair
$(range,g)$ characterizing an enumerator  (as  described above). We  also
assume that  the `identity'  element at each  level already  has the kind
corresponding to that level.

\)StabChainStrong := function( $S$, $newgens$ )
\)\quad for $i$  in [ 1 .. Length( $newgens$ ) ]  do
\)\qquad $newgens$[ $i$ ] := AutomorphismOnEnumerator( $S$.identity, %
         $newgens$[ $i$ ] );
\)\quad od;
\)\quad {\rm Extend the Schreier tree of $S$ with $newgens$.}
\)\quad for $sch$  in {\rm Schreier generators}  do
\)\qquad if $sch \notin S$.stabilizer  then
\)\qquad\quad StabChainStrong( $S$.stabilizer, [ $sch$ ] );
\)\qquad fi;
\)\quad od;
\)end;

operation domain of a permutation group $G$ is  called a base if the only
element of $G$ that fixes $B$ elementwise is the identity.

*basic orbit*, if $(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ is  a base for a permutation  group,
the orbits $b_iG^{(i)}$ of the corresponding stabilizers (see "Stabilizer
chains") are called the basic orbits.

(unordered) partition of $\Omega$ into cells is called a block system for
$G$ if $G$ permutes these cells setwise.

*blocks   homomorphism*,   the operation   homomorphism   of the  setwise
operation on a block system.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

*commutator subgroup*, the commutator  subgroup $[U,V]$ of  two subgroups
$U$ and $V$ of  a group $G$  is the  group  generated by all  commutators
$[u,v]=u^{-1}v^{-1}uv$ with $u\in U$ and $v\in V$.

all conjugates of $U$  under $G$, i.e., the biggest  subgroup of $U$ that
is normal in $G$.

*coset*, a left coset of a subgroup $U$ in its supergroup $G$ is a subset

the smallest integer greater than or equal to~$i / p$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\letter L

(see exponents, w.r.t.~pcgs). By   convention, the identity   element has
leading exponent~1.

*Loewy series* of a $p$-group $G$, the series $F_pG = J^0  > J^1 > \ldots

We  often write $\omega g$  for  $\varphi(\omega,g)$, the $\varphi$ being
understood.

\Omega\}$.

*product  action of a wreath  product*, if $G$  is a permutation group on
$\Omega$  and    $\sigma\colon H\to    S_n$,   then  the  wreath  product
$H\wr_\sigma G$ acts   on  $\Omega^n$ with  $G^n$  acting on   $\Omega^n$
componentwise     and      $H$  permuting     the    $n$~coordinates   by
$(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n).               (h;g_1,\ldots,g_n)           =
(\omega_{1\sigma_h^{-1}}.             g_{1\sigma_h^{-1}},         \ldots,
\omega_{n\sigma_h^{-1}}. g_{n\sigma_h^{-1}})$. This is called the product

t_ig_j (\overline{t_ig_j})^{-1};\, i=1,\ldots,m, \, j=1,\ldots,n \rangle$
where $\overline g$  denotes the transversal element with  $Ug=U\overline
g$.   This statement  is   called  Schreier's subgroup  theorem  and  the
generators for $U$ are called Schreier generators.

cartesian  product $H\times  G$   with  multiplication  $(h,g).(h',g')  =
(hh',g\varphi_{h'}.g')$.

*semiregular*, an operation  is semiregular if   the stabilizer of  every
point is trivial.

*sign homomorphism*,  the sign of a  permutation $p\in S_n$ is defined to
be $1$ if $p$  is the product of an  even number of transpositions `(ij)'
with   $`i' \ne `j'$, and  $-1$  otherwise. The  sign  of an $n$-cycle is
$(-1)^{n-1}$.

and~$\{1\}$.

*socle*, the socle of a group is the product of its minimal (non-trivial)
normal subgroups.

to the trivial subgroup with abelian factors $G_{i-1}/G_i$.

*solvable residuum*,  the last member of the  derived series, which  is a
perfect normal subgroup with the largest possible solvable factor group.

in $G$ of a point $\omega\in\Omega$ is the subgroup ${\rm Stab}_G(\omega)
= \{g\in G\mid \omega g=\omega\}$.

*stabilizer  chain*, if $(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$   is a base  for a permutation
group $G$, we  associate with it the stabilizer  chain  $G = G^{(1)}  \ge
G^{(2)}  \ge  \ldots \ge G^{(r+1)}  =  \{{\rm id}\}$ with $G^{(i+1)}={\rm
Stab}_{G^{(i)}}(b_i)$ for $i>0$.

*strong generating  set*, a set  $S$ of generators for $G$  is said to be
strong relative to a base $B$ if contains generating sets for all members
of the stabilizer chain, in other words, if $\langle S\cap G^{(i)}\rangle
= G^{(i)}$ for all~$i$.

*subnormal*, a subgroup $U$  of $G$ is  subnormal if there is a subnormal
series from $G$ to $U$ whose last member is~$U$.

*subnormal series*, if $U$ is a subgroup of $G$,  a subnormal series from
$G$ to $U$ is a finite series of subgroups $G = G_0 > \ldots > G_n$ (with
strict inclusions) such that  $G_i$  is normal  in $G_{i-1}$ for   $1\leq
i\leq n$ and  such that there is no  subgroup above  $U$ which is  normal
in~$G_n$.

*Sylow $p$-subgroup*, a subgroup of $G$  whose order is the largest power
of $p$ dividing the order of $G$. Exists always by Sylow's theorem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\letter T

*transitive*,   an operation  of a  group  on $\Omega$  is  transitive if
$\Omega$ forms one   orbit. The operation   is $k$-transitive,  if it  is
transitive   on    the non-repeating   $k$-tuples in   $\Omega^k$  (under
componentwise action).

*trivial subgroup*, the subgroup consisting only of the identity element.

*two-closure of a permutation  group*, the two-closure of $G\le S_\Omega$
is   the  supergroup      $\{g\in S_\Omega\mid  (\omega,\omega')Gg      =
(\omega,\omega')G\,\forall \omega,\omega' \in\Omega\}$ of~$G$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\letter U

*upper central  series*, the upper  central series of a  group $G$ is the
series $\{1\} =  G_0 \< G_1 \< \ldots$  defined such that $G_{i+1} / G_i$
is the centre of $G / G_i$ for $i\ge0$. Unlike for the other series, this
definition works ``bottom up'', and the series reaches $G$ if and only if
$G$ is nilpotent.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\letter W

*wreath product*, given  groups  $G$, $H$  and an operation  homomorphism
$\sigma\colon H\to S_n$, the wreath product $H\wr_\sigma G$ is defined to
be the semidirect product of  $G^n$ with~$H$ where  $H$ acts on $G^n$  by
permuting  the  direct    factors via~$(g_1,    \ldots,  g_n)\sigma_h   =
(g_{1\sigma_h^{-1}},   \ldots,   g_{n\sigma_h^{-1}})$.    If  $G$  is   a
permutation group, there is an imprimitive action and a product action of
$H\wr_\sigma G$ (see there).

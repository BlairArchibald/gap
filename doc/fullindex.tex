% changed explanation at the beginning of the index
\def\IndexMatter{%
This index covers the four main books of the {\GAP} manual.
Page numbers are given in the form <book><chapter>--<page_within_chapter>.
A page
number in {\it italics} refers to a whole section which is devoted to the
indexed subject. Some index entries refer to exercises, whose answers in
appendix~A should then also be read. Keywords are sorted with case and
spaces ignored, e.g., ```PermutationCharacter''' comes before ``permutation
group''.%

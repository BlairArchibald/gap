\PreliminaryChapter{Group Products}

This chapter describes the various group product constructions that are
possible in {\GAP}.
Currently the only methods provided for products are for permutation groups
and pc groups when the product can be naturally represented as a group of the
same kind.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Direct Products}

The direct product of  groups is the cartesian product (of the groups
considered as element sets) with component-wise multiplication.

\Declaration{DirectProduct}
{\GAP} will try to choose an efficient representation for the direct
product. For example the direct product of permutation groups will be a
permutation group again and the direct product of PC groups will be a PC
group.

The functions `Embedding' and `Projection' (see "Embeddings and
Projections") will give the various embeddings of the components in the
direct product and from the direct product on the components.

\Section{Semidirect Products}

The semidirect product of a group <N> with a group <G> acting via a
homomorphism $\alpha$ from <G> into the automorphism group of <N> is the
cartesian product $<G>\times<N>$ with the multiplication
$(g,n)\cdot(h,m)=(gh,n^{(h\alpha)}m)$.

\Declaration{SemidirectProduct}
The first `Embedding' into the direct product embeds <G>, the second embeds
<N>. The function `Projection' returns the projection onto the group <G>.

\Section{Subdirect Products}

The subdirect product of the groups $G$ and $H$ with respect to the
epimorphisms $\varphi\colon G\to A$ and $\psi\colon H\to A$ (for a common
group $A$) is the subgroup of the direct product $G\times H$ consisting of
the elements $(g,h)$ for which $g\varphi=h\psi$. It is the pull-back of the
diagram:
%display{tex}
$$
\matrix{
&&G&\cr
&&\Big\downarrow&\varphi\cr
H&\mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\psi}&A&\cr
}
$$

%                   | phi

\Declaration{SubdirectProduct}
The operation `Projection' returns the projections on both groups.

\Section{Wreath Products}

The wreath product of a group <G> with a permutation group <P> acting on <n>
points is the semidirect product of the normal subgroup $<G>^n$ with the
complement <P> which acts by permuting the components.

\Declaration{WreathProduct}
The operation `Embedding' provides the <n> embeddings of <G> in the wreath
product, `Embedding(<W>,<n>+1)' is the embedding of <P>. The `Projection' of
the wreath product provides the projection onto the acting group <P>.
\beginexample
gap> g:=Group((1,2,3),(1,2));
Group( [ (1,2,3), (1,2) ] )
gap> p:=Group((1,2,3));
Group( [ (1,2,3) ] )
gap> w:=WreathProduct(g,p);
Group( [ (1,2,3), (1,2), (4,5,6), (4,5), (7,8,9), (7,8), 
  (1,4,7)(2,5,8)(3,6,9) ] )

gap> Embedding(w,1);
1st embedding into Group( [ (1,2,3), (1,2), (4,5,6), (4,5), (7,8,9), (7,8),

For permutation groups, `WreathProduct' returns the imprimitive action of
the wreath product.

\Section{Embeddings and Projections}

\>Embedding(<P>,<nr>) F

returns the <nr>-th embedding in the group product <P>. The specific meaning
of this embedding is described in the section for the appropriate product.

\>Projection(<P>[,<nr>]) F

returns the <nr>-th projection of the group product <P>. The specific
projection returned is described in the section for the appropriate product.

\Chapter{Rationals}

The *rationals* form a very important field.  On the one hand it is the
quotient field of the integers (see chapter~"Integers").
On the other hand it is the prime field of the fields of characteristic zero
(see chapter~"Abelian Number Fields").

The former comment suggests the representation actually used.
A rational is represented as a pair of integers, called  *numerator* and
*denominator*.
Numerator and denominator are *reduced*, i.e., their greatest common divisor
is 1.
If the denominator is 1, the rational is in fact an integer and is
represented as such.
The numerator holds the sign of the rational,
thus the denominator is always positive.

Because the underlying integer arithmetic can compute with arbitrary size
integers, the  rational arithmetic is always exact, even for rationals
whose numerators and denominators have thousands of digits.

`Rationals' is a subset of `Cyclotomics',
so see chapter~"Cyclotomic Numbers" for arithmetic operations and comparison of
rationals.
Functions for the field `Rationals' can be found in
chapters~"fields and
division rings"
and~"Abelian Number Fields".

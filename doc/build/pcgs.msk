\Chapter{Polycyclic Groups}

A group <G> is *polycyclic* if there exists a subnormal series
$G = C_1 > C_2 > \ldots > C_n > C_{n+1} = \{1\}$
with cyclic factors. Such a series is called *pc series* of <G>.

Every polycyclic group is solvable and every finite solvable group
is polycyclic. However, there are infinite solvable groups which
are not polycyclic.

In {\GAP} there exists a large number of methods for polycyclic groups
which are based upon the polycyclic structure of these groups. These
methods are usually very efficient and hence {\GAP} tries to use them
whenever possible.

In {\GAP}~3 these methods have been available for AgGroups only; that
is, for groups defined via a power-commutator presentation, see
Chapter~"Pc Groups" for the {\GAP}~4 analogon. This has changed in {\GAP}~4
where these methods can be applied to many types of groups. For example,
the methods can be applied to permutation groups or matrix groups which
are known to be polycyclic. The only exception is the representation as
finitely presented group for which the polycyclic methods cannot
be used in general.

At the current state of implementations the methods for polycyclic
groups can only be applied to finite groups. However, a more general
implementation is planned.

%%  Most of the methods for polycyclic groups are due to Frank Celler, Bettina
%%  Eick, Alexander Hulpke and Werner Nickel. The methods to consider a solvable
%%  permutation group as a polycyclic group are due to Heiko Thei{\ss}en.

\Section{Polycyclic Generating Systems}

Let <G> be a polycyclic group with a pc series as above.  A
*polycyclic generating sequence* (*pcgs* for short) of <G> is a
sequence $P := (g_1, \ldots, g_n)$ of elements of <G> such that
$C_i = \langle C_{i+1}, g_i \rangle$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$.
Note that each polycyclic group has a pcgs, but except for very
small groups, a pcgs is not unique.

For each index $i$ the subsequence of elements $(g_i, \ldots, g_n)$
forms a pcgs of the subgroup $C_i$. In particular, these *tails*
generate the subgroups of the pc series and hence we say that
the pc series is *determined* by $P$.

Let $r_i$ be the index of $C_{i+1}$ in $C_i$ which is either
a finite positive number or infinity. Then $r_i$ is the order of
$g_i C_{i+1}$ and we call the resulting list of indices the
*relative orders* of the pcgs <P>.

Moreover, with respect to a given pcgs $(g_1, \ldots, g_n)$ each
element <g> of <G> can be represented in a unique
way as a product $g = g_1^{e_1} \cdot g_2^{e_2} \cdots g_n^{e_n}$
with exponents $e_i \in \{0, \ldots, r_i-1\}$, if $r_i$ is finite,
and $e_i \in \Z$ otherwise.
Words of this form are called *normal words* or *words in normal form*.
Then the integer vector $[e_1, \ldots, e_n]$ is called the
*exponent vector* of the element $g$. Furthermore, the smallest
index $k$ such that $e_k \neq 0$ is called the *depth* of <g> and
$e_k$ is the *leading exponent* of <g>.

For many applications we have to assume that each of the relative orders
$r_i$ is either a prime or infinity. This is equivalent to saying that
there are no trivial factors in the pc series and the finite factors of the
pc series are maximal refined. Then we obtain that $r_i$ is the order of
$g C_{i+1}$ for all elements $g$ in $C_i \setminus C_{i+1}$ and we call
$r_i$ the *relative order* of the element $g$.

\Section{Computing a Pcgs}

Suppose a group <G> is given; for example, let <G> be a permutation
or matrix group. Then we can ask {\GAP} to compute a pcgs of this group.
If <G> is not polycyclic, the result will be `fail'.

Note that these methods can only be applied if <G> is not given
as finitely presented group. For finitely presented groups one
can try to compute a pcgs via the polycyclic quotient methods,
see "Quotient Methods".

Note also that a pcgs behaves like a list.

\Section{Exponents of Special Products}

There are certain products of elements whose exponents are used often within
algorithms, and which might be obtained more easily than by computing the
product first and to obtain its exponents afterwards. The operations in this
section provide a way to obtain such exponent vectors directly.

(The circumstances under which these operations give a speedup depend very
much on the pcgs and the representation of elements that is used. So the
following operations are not guaranteed to give a speedup in every case,
however the default methods are not slower than to compute the exponents of
a product and thus these operations should *always* be used if applicable.)

\Declaration{ExponentsConjugateLayer}

The second class are exponents of products of the generators which make up
the pcgs. If the pcgs used is a `FamilyPcgs' these exponents can be looked
up and do not need to be computed.

\Section{Subgroups of Polycyclic Groups - Induced Pcgs}

Let <U> be a subgroup of <G> and let <P> be a pcgs of <G> as above such
that <P> determines the subnormal series $G = C_1 > \ldots > C_{n+1} =
\{1\}$. Then the series of subgroups $U \cap C_i$ is a subnormal series
of <U> with cyclic or trivial factors. Hence, if we choose an element
$u_{i_j} \in (U \cap C_{i_j}) \setminus (U \cap C_{i_j+1})$ whenever
this factor is non-trivial, then we obtain a pcgs $Q = (u_{i_1}, \ldots,
u_{i_m})$ of $U$. We say that $Q$ is an *induced pcgs* with respect to
<P>. The pcgs <P> is the *parent pcgs* to the induced pcgs <Q>.

Note that the pcgs $Q$ is induced with respect to <P> if and only
if the matrix of exponent vectors of the elements $u_{i_j}$ with
respect to <P> is in upper triangular form. Thus $Q$ is not unique in
general.

In particular, the elements of an induced pcgs do *not necessarily* have
leading coefficient 1 relative to the inducing pcgs. The attribute
`LeadCoeffsIGS' (see~"LeadCoeffsIGS") holds the leading coefficients in case
they have to be renormed in an algorithm.

Each induced pcgs is a pcgs and hence allows all elementary operations
for pcgs. On the other hand each pcgs could be transformed into an
induced pcgs for the group defined by the pcgs, but note that an
arbitrary pcgs is in general not an induced pcgs for technical reasons.

An induced pcgs is ``compatible'' with its parent.

\Section{Factor Groups of Polycyclic Groups - Modulo Pcgs}

Let <N> be a normal subgroup of <G> such that <G/N> is polycyclic
with pcgs $(h_1 N, \ldots, h_r N)$. Then we call the sequence of
preimages $(h_1, \ldots h_r)$ a *modulo pcgs* of <G/N>.
<G> is called the *numerator* of the modulo pcgs and <N> is the
*denominator* of the modulo pcgs.

Modulo pcgs are often used to facilitate efficient computations with
factor groups, since they allow computations with factor groups without
formally defining the factor group at all.

All elementary operations of pcgs, see Sections "Elementary Operations
for a Pcgs" and "Elementary Operations for a Pcgs and an Element",
apply to modulo pcgs as well. However, it is in general not possible to
compute induced pcgs with respect to a modulo pcgs.

\Declaration{ModuloPcgs}
`ModuloPcgs' will return *a* pcgs for the factor, there is no guarantee that
it will be ``compatible'' with any other pcgs. If this is required, the
`mod' operator must be used on induced pcgs, see below.

\Declaration{IsModuloPcgs}

Additionally there are two more elementary operations for modulo pcgs.

\Declaration{NumeratorOfModuloPcgs}
\Declaration{DenominatorOfModuloPcgs}

\beginexample

Modulo Pcgs can also be built from compatible induced pcgs.
Let <G> be a group with pcgs <P> and let <I> be an induced pcgs of
a normal subgroup <N> of <G>. (Respectively: <P> and <I> are both induced
with respect to the *same* Pcgs.) Then we can compute a modulo pcgs of
<G> mod <N> by

\>`<P> mod <I>'{modulo!for pcgs}

Note that in this case we obtain the advantage that the
`NumeratorOfModuloPcgs' and the `DenominatorOfModuloPcgs' are
just <P> and <I>, respectively, and hence are unique.

The resulting modulo pcgs will consist of a subset of <P> and will be
``compatible'' with <P> (or its parent).

By definition, a pcgs determines a pc series of its underlying group.
However, in many applications it will be necessary that this pc series
refines a normal series with certain properties; for example, a normal
series with abelian factors.

There are functions in {\GAP} to compute a pcgs through a normal series
with elementary abelian factors, a central series or the lower p-central
series. See also Section "Special Pcgs" for a more explicit possibility.

\Section{Special Pcgs}

In short, a special pcgs is a pcgs which has particularly nice properties,
for example it always refines an elementary abelian series, for $p$-groups
it even refines a central series. These nice properties permit particularly
efficient algorithms.

Let <G> be a finite polycyclic group. A *special pcgs* of <G> is a pcgs
which is closely related to a Hall system and the maximal subgroups of <G>.
These pcgs have been introduced by C. R. Leedham-Green who also gave an
algorithm to compute them. Improvements to this algorithm
%%  and the {\GAP} implementation
are due to Bettina Eick.  For a more detailed account of
their definition the reader is referred to \cite{Eick97}

To introduce the definition of special pcgs we first need to define
the *LG-series* and *head complements* of a finite polycyclic group <G>.
Let $G = G_1 > G_2 > \ldots G_m > G_{m+1} = \{1\}$ be the lower
nilpotent series of $G$; that is, $G_i$ is the smallest normal
subgroup of $G_{i-1}$ with nilpotent factor. To obtain the LG-series
of <G> we need to refine this series. Thus consider a factor $F_i :=
G_i / G_{i+1}$. Since $F_i$ is finite nilpotent, it is a direct
product of its Sylow subgroups, say $F_i = P_{i,1} \cdots P_{i,r_i}$.
For each Sylow $p_j$-subgroup $P_{i, j}$ we can consider its
lower $p_j$-central series. To obtain a characteristic central series
with elementary abelian factors of $F_i$ we loop over its Sylow subgroups.
Each time we consider $P_{i,j}$ in this process we take the next step of
its lower $p_j$-central series into the series of $F_i$. If there
is no next step, then we just skip the consideration of $P_{i,j}$.
Note that the second term of the lower $p$-central series of a $p$-group
is in fact its Frattini subgroup. Thus the Frattini subgroup of $F_i$
is contained in the computed series of this group. We denote the
Frattini subgroup of $F_i = G_i / G_{i+1}$ by $G_i^{*} / G_{i+1}$.

The factors $G_i / G_i^{*}$ are called the heads of $G$, while the
(possibly trivial) factors $G_i^{*} / G_{i+1}$ are the tails of $G$.
A head complement of $G$ is a subgroup $U$ of $G$ such that $U / G_i^{*}$
is a complement to the head $G_i / G_i^{*}$ in $G / G_i^{*}$ for some $i$.

Now we are able to define a special pcgs of <G>. It is a pcgs of <G>
with three additional properties. First, the pc series determined
by the pcgs refines the LG-series of <G>. Second, a special pcgs
*exhibits* a Hall system of the group <G>; that is, for each set of
primes $\pi$ the elements of the pcgs with relative order in $\pi$
form a pcgs of a Hall $\pi$-subgroup in a Hall system of <G>.
Third, a special pcgs exhibits a head complement for each head
of <G>.

To record information about the LG-series with the special pcgs
we define the *LGWeights* of the special pcgs. These weights are
a list which contains a weight $w$ for each elements $g$ of the
special pcgs. Such a weight $w$ represents the smallest subgroup of
the LG-series containing $g$.

Since the LG-series is defined in terms of the lower nilpotent
series, Sylow subgroups of the factors and lower
$p$-central series of the Sylow subgroup, the weight $w$ is a
triple. More precisely, $g$ is contained in the $w[1]$th term
$U$ of the lower nilpotent series of <G>, but not in the next smaller
one $V$. Then $w[3]$ is a prime such that $g V$ is contained in the
Sylow $w[3]$-subgroup $P/V$ of $U/V$. Moreover, $gV$ is contained in
the $w[2]$th term of the lower $p$-central series of $P/V$.

There are two more attributes of a special pcgs containing
information about the LG-series: the list *LGLayers* and the
list *LGFirst*. The list of layers corresponds to the elements
of the special pcgs and denotes the layer of the LG-series in
which an element lies. The list LGFirst corresponds to the
LG-series and gives the number of the first element in the
special pcgs of the corresponding subgroup.

Thus the first group, `SmallGroup(96, 220)', has a lower nilpotent series of
length 1; that is, the group is nilpotent. It is a direct product
of its Sylow subgroups. Moreover the Sylow 2-subgroup is generated by
$f1, f2, f3, f4, f6$ and the Sylow 3-subgroup is generated by $f5$.
The lower 2-central series of the Sylow 2-subgroup has length 2
and the second subgroup in this series is generated by $f6$.

The second group, `SmallGroup(96, 120)', has a lower nilpotent series of length
2 and hence is not nilpotent. The second subgroup in this series
is just the Sylow 3-subgroup and it is generated by $f6$. The subgroup
generated by $f1, \ldots, f5$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of the group and
also a head complement to the second head of the group. Its lower
2-central series has length 2.

In this example the `FamilyPcgs' of the groups used was a special pcgs, but
this is not necessarily the case. For performance reasons it can be worth to
enforce this, see~"IsomorphismSpecialPcGroup".

\Section{Orbit Stabilizer Methods for Polycyclic Groups}

If a pcgs <pcgs> is known for a group <G>, then orbits and stabilizers
can be computed by a special method which is particularly efficient.
Note that within this function only the elements in <pcgs> and the
relative orders of <pcgs> are needed. Hence this function works effectively
even if the elementary operations for <pcgs> are slow.

\Section{Conjugacy Classes in Solvable Groups}

There are a variety of algorithms to compute conjugacy classes and
centralizers in solvable groups via epimorphic images
(\cite{FelschNeubueser79}, \cite{MeckyNeubueser89}, \cite{Theissen93}).
Usually these are only invoked as methods, but it is possible to access the
algorithm directly.

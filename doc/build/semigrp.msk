\Chapter{Semigroups}

This chapter describes functions for creating semigroups
and determining information about them.

%%  Support for algebraic semigroup theory in {\GAP} was designed by Andrew
%%  Solomon, based on code by Goetz Pfeiffer, and was implemented by Isabel
%%  Araujo, Robert Arthur, and Andrew Solomon.

\Section{Making transformation semigroups}

Cayley's Theorem gives special status to semigroups of
transformations, and accordingly there are special functions
to deal with them, and to create them from other finite
semigroups.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Ideals of semigroups}

Ideals of semigroups are the same as ideals of the semigroup when 
considered as a magma.
For documentation on ideals for magmas, see `Magma' ("Magma").

\Declaration{IsLeftSemigroupIdeal}
\Declaration{IsRightSemigroupIdealEnumerator}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Congruences for semigroups}

An equivalence or a congruence on a semigroup is the
equivalence or congruence on the semigroup considered as a magma.
So, to deal with equivalences and congruences on semigroups,
magma functions are used.
For documentation on equivalences and congruences for magmas,
see `Magma' ("Magma").

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Quotients}

Given a semigroup and a congruence on the semigroup, one
can construct a new semigroup: the quotient semigroup.
The following functions deal with quotient semigroups in {\GAP}.

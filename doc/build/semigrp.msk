\Chapter{Semigroups}

This chapter describes functions for creating semigroups
and determining information about them.

%%  Support for algebraic semigroup theory in GAP was designed by Andrew
%%  Solomon, based on code by Goetz Pfeiffer, and was implemented by Isabel
%%  Araujo, Robert Arthur, and Andrew Solomon.

\Section{Making transformation semigroups}
Cayley's Theorem gives special status to semigroups of
transformations, and accordingly there are special functions
to deal with them, and to create them from other finite
semigroups.

\Section{Ideals of semigroups}

Ideals of semigroups are the same as ideals of the semigroup when 
considered as a magma.
For documentation on ideals for magmas see "Magma".

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Congruences}

An equivalence or a congruence on a semigroup is the
equivalence or congruence on the semigroup considered as a magma.
So, to deal with equivalences and congruences on semigroups,
magma funtions are used.
For documentation on equivalences and congruences for magmas see "Magma".

\Section{Quotients}

Given a semigroup and a congruence on the semigroup, one
can construct a new semigroup: the quotient semigroup.
The following funtions deal with quotient semigroups in {\GAP}.

\Section{Green's Relations}

Green's equivalence relations play a very important role in semigroup
theory. In this section we describe how they can be used in {\GAP}.

The five green's relations are <R>, <L>, <J>, <H>, <D>:
two elements <x>, <y> from <S> are <R>-related if and only if
$xS^1 = yS^1$, <L>-related if and only if $S^1x=S^1y$ and <J>-related
if and only if $S^1xS^1=S^1yS^1$; finally, $H = R \wedge L$, and
<D = R o L>.

Recall that relations <R>, <L> and <J> induce a partial order among
the elements of the semigroup: for two elements <x>, <y> from <S>,
we say that <x> is  less than or equal to <y> in the order on <R>
if $xS^1 \subseteq yS^1$;
similarly, $x$ is less than or equal to $y$ under $L$ if
$S^1x\subseteq S^1y$;
finally <x> is less than or equal to <y> under <J> if
$S^1xS^1 \subseteq S^1tS^1$.
We extend this preorder to a partial order on equivalence classes in
the natural way.

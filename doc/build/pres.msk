\Chapter{Presentations and Tietze Transformations}

A finite presentation describes a group, but usually there is a multitude of
presentations that describe isomorphic groups. Therefore a presentation in
{\GAP} is different from a finitely presented group though there are ways to
translate between both.

An important feature of presentations is that they can be modified (see
sections "Changing Presentations" to "Tietze Transformations that introduce
new Generators").

%%  The code for presentations was designed and implemented by Volkmar Felsch.

Most of the functions creating presentations and all functions performing
Tietze transformations on them sort the relators by increasing lengths. The
function `PresentationFpGroup' is an exception because it is intended to
reflect the relators that were used to define the involved FpGroup. You may
use the following command to sort the presentation.

The two stage algorithm saves an essential amount of space by
constructing two coset tables of lengths $|H|$ and $|G|/|H|$ instead of
just one coset table of length $|G|$. The next example shows an application
of this option in the case of a subgroup of size 7920 and index 12 in a
permutation group of size 95040.

Before it is returned, the resulting presentation is being simplified by
appropriate calls of the function `SimplifyPresentation' (see "Tietze
Transformations"), but without allowing any eliminations of generators.
This restriction guarantees that we get a bijection between the list of
generators of <G> and the list of generators in the presentation. Hence,
if the generators of <G> are redundant and if you don{\pif}t care for the
bijection, you may get a shorter presentation by calling the function
`SimplifyPresentation', now without this restriction, once more yourself.

\beginexample
gap> H := Group(
> [ (2,5,3), (2,7,5), (1,8,4), (1,8,6), (4,8,6), (3,5,7) ], () );;

gap> SimplifyPresentation( P );
#I  there are 4 generators and 10 relators of total length 36
\endexample

If you apply the function `FpGroupPresentation' to the resulting
presentation you will get a finitely presented group isomorphic to <G>.
Note, however, that the function `IsomorphismFpGroup' (see
"IsomorphismFpGroup") is recommended for this purpose.

In fact, the command

\begintt
H := SimplifiedFpGroup( G );
\endtt

is an abbreviation of the command sequence

\begintt
P := PresentationFpGroup( G, 0 );;
SimplifyPresentation( P );
H := FpGroupPresentation( P );
\endtt

which applies a rather simple-minded strategy of Tietze transformations
to the intermediate presentation <P>.
If, for some concrete group, the resulting presentation is unsatisfying,
then you should try a more sophisticated, interactive use of the
available Tietze transformation commands (see "Tietze Transformations").

The Reduced Reidemeister-Schreier algorithm is a modification of the
Reidemeister-Schreier algorithm of George Havas \cite{Hav74b}. It was
proposed by Joachim Neub{\accent127u}ser and first implemented in 1986 by
Andrea Lucchini and Volkmar Felsch in the SPAS system \cite{Spa89}. Like
the Reidemeister-Schreier algorithm of George Havas, it needs only the
presentation of <G> and a coset table of <H> in <G> to construct a
presentation of <H>.

Whenever you call the command `PresentationSubgroupRrs', it first obtains
a coset table of <H> in <G> if not given. Next, a set of generators of <H>
is determined by reconstructing the coset table and introducing in that
process as many Schreier generators of <H> in <G> as are needed to do a
Felsch strategy coset enumeration without any coincidences. (In general,
though containing redundant generators, this set will be much smaller than
the set of all Schreier generators. That is why we call the method the
*Reduced* Reidemeister-Schreier.)

After having constructed this set of *primary subgroup generators*, say,
the coset table is extended to an *augmented coset table* which describes
the action of the group generators on coset representatives, i.e., on
elements instead of cosets. For this purpose, suitable words in the
(primary) subgroup generators have to be associated to the coset table
entries. In order to keep the lengths of these words short, additional
*secondary subgroup generators* are introduced as abbreviations of
subwords. Their number may be large.

Finally, a Reidemeister rewriting process is used to get defining
relators for <H> from the relators of <G>. As the resulting presentation
of <H> is a presentation on primary *and* secondary generators, in
general you will have to simplify it by appropriate Tietze
transformations (see "Tietze Transformations") or by the command
`DecodeTree' (see "DecodeTree") before you can use it. Therefore it is
returned in the form of a presentation, <P> say.

Compared with the Modified Todd-Coxeter method described below, the
Reduced Reidemeister-Schreier method (as well as Havas{\pif} original
Reidemeister-Schreier program) has the advantage that it does not require
generators of <H> to be given if a coset table of <H> in <G> is known.
This provides a possibility to compute a presentation of the normal
closure of a given subgroup (see the `PresentationNormalClosureRrs'
command below).

For certain applications you may be interested in getting not only just a
presentation for <H>, but also a relation between the involved generators of
<H> and the generators of <G>. The subgroup generators in the presentation
are sorted such that the primary generators precede the secondary ones.
Moreover, for each secondary subgroup generator there is a relator in the
presentation which expresses this generator as a word in preceding ones.
Hence, all we need in addition is a list of words in the generators of <G>
which express the primary subgroup generators. In fact, such a list is
provided in the attribute `PrimaryGeneratorWords' of the resulting
presentation.

The so called Modified Todd-Coxeter method was proposed, in slightly
different forms, by Nathan S.~Mendelsohn and William O.~J.~Moser in 1966.
Moser{\pif}s method was proved in \cite{BC76}. It has been generalized to
cover a broad spectrum of different versions (see the survey \cite{Neu82}).

The `Modified Todd-Coxeter' method performs an enumeration of coset
representatives. It proceeds like an ordinary coset enumeration (see
"Coset Tables and Coset Enumeration"), but as the product of a coset
representative by a group generator or its inverse need not be a coset
representative itself, the Modified Todd-Coxeter has to store a kind of
correction element for each coset table entry. Hence it builds up a so
called *augmented coset table* of <H> in <G> consisting of the ordinary
coset table and a second table in parallel which contains the associated
subgroup elements.

Theoretically, these subgroup elements could be expressed as words in the
given generators of <H>, but in general these words tend to become
unmanageable because of their enormous lengths. Therefore, a highly
redundant list of subgroup generators is built up starting from the given
(``*primary*'') generators of <H> and adding additional
(``*secondary*'') generators which are defined as abbreviations of
suitable words of length two in the preceding generators such that each
of the subgroup elements in the augmented coset table can be expressed as
a word of length at most one in the resulting (primary *and* secondary)
subgroup generators.

Then a rewriting process (which is essentially a kind of Reidemeister
rewriting process) is used to get relators for <H> from the defining
relators of <G>.

The resulting presentation involves all the primary, but not all the
secondary generators of <H>. In fact, it contains only those secondary
generators which explicitly occur in the augmented coset table. If we
extended this presentation by those secondary generators which are not
yet contained in it as additional generators, and by the definitions of
all secondary generators as additional relators, we would get a
presentation of <H>, but, in general, we would end up with a large number
of generators and relators.

On the other hand, if we avoid this extension, the current presentation
will not necessarily define <H> although we have used the same rewriting
process which in the case of the `PresentationSubgroupRrs' command
computes a defining set of relators for <H> from an augmented coset table
and defining relators of <G>. The different behaviour here is caused by
the fact that coincidences may have occurred in the Modified Todd-Coxeter
coset enumeration.

To overcome this problem without extending the presentation by all
secondary generators, the `PresentationSubgroupMtc' command applies the
so called *decoding tree* algorithm which provides a more economical
approach. The reader is strongly recommended to carefully read section
"DecodeTree" where this algorithm is described in more detail. Here we
will only mention that this procedure may add a lot of intermediate
generators and relators (and even change the isomorphism type)
in a process which in fact eliminates all
secondary generators from the presentation and hence finally provides
a presentation of <H> on the primary, i.e., the originally given,
generators of <H>. This is a remarkable advantage of the command
`PresentationSubgroupMtc' compared to the command `PresentationSubgroupRrs'.
But note that, for some particular subgroup <H>, the Reduced
Reidemeister-Schreier method might quite well produce a more concise
presentation.

The resulting presentation is returned in the form of a presentation,
<P> say.

As the function `PresentationSubgroupRrs' described above (see there for
details), the function `PresentationSubgroupMtc' returns a list of the
primary subgroup generators of <H> in the attribute
`PrimaryGeneratorWords' of <P>. In fact, this list is not very exciting here
because it is just a shallow copy of the attribute value
`GeneratorsOfPresentation(H)', however it is
needed to guarantee a certain consistency between the results of the
different functions for computing subgroup presentations.

Though the decoding tree routine already involves a lot of Tietze
transformations, we recommend that you try to further simplify the
resulting presentation by appropriate Tietze transformations (see "Tietze
Transformations").

\Section{Relators in a Presentation}

In order to speed up the Tietze transformation routines,
each relator in a presentation <P> is internally represented by a
list of positive or negative generator numbers, i.e., each factor of the
proper {\GAP} word is represented by the position number of the
corresponding generator with respect to the current list of generators,
or by the respective negative number, if the factor is the inverse of a
generator. Note that the numbering of the generators in Tietze words is
always relative to a generator list and bears no relation to the internal
numbering of generators in a family of associative words.

\Section{Printing Presentations}

Whenever you create a presentation <P>, say, or assign it to a variable,
{\GAP} will respond by printing <P>. However, as <P> may contain a lot of
generators and many relators of large length, it would be annoying if the
standard print facilities displayed all this information in detail.
So they restrict the printout to just one line of text containing the number
of generators, the number of relators, and the total length of all relators
of <P>. As compensation, {\GAP} offers some special print commands which
display various details of a presentation.

\Section{Tietze Transformations}

The commands in this section can be used to modify a presentation by Tietze
transformations.

In general, the aim of such modifications will be to *simplify* the given
presentation, i.e., to reduce the number of generators and the number of
relators without increasing too much the sum of all relator lengths which
we will call the *total length* of the presentation. Depending on the
concrete presentation under investigation one may end up with a nice,
short presentation or with a very huge one.

Unfortunately there is no algorithm which could be applied to find the
shortest presentation which can be obtained by Tietze transformations
from a given one. Therefore, what {\GAP} offers are some lower-level
Tietze transformation commands and, in addition, some higher-level
commands which apply the lower-level ones in a kind of default strategy
which of course cannot be the optimal choice for all presentations.

The design of these commands follows closely the concept of the ANU
Tietze transformation program \cite{Hav69} and its
later revisions (see \cite{HKRR84}, \cite{Rob88}).

Roughly speaking, `TzGo' consists of a loop over a
procedure which involves two phases: In the *search phase* it calls
`TzSearch' and `TzSearchEqual' described below which try to reduce the
relator lengths by substituting common subwords of relators, in the
*elimination phase* it calls the command `TzEliminate' described below
(or, more precisely, a subroutine of `TzEliminate' in order to save some
administrative overhead) which tries to eliminate generators that can be
expressed as words in the remaining generators.

If `TzGo' succeeds in reducing the number of generators,
the number of relators, or the total length of all relators, it
displays the new status before returning (provided that you did not set
the print level to zero). However, it does not provide any output if all
these three values have remained unchanged, even if the command
`TzSearchEqual' involved has changed the presentation such that another
call of `TzGo' might provide further progress. Hence, in such a
case it makes sense to repeat the call of the command for several times
(or to call the command `TzGoGo' instead).

\Declaration{TzGoGo}

The result of the Tietze transformations can be affected substantially by
the options parameters (see "Tietze Options"). To demonstrate the effect
of the `eliminationsLimit' parameter, we will give an example in which we
handle a subgroup of index 240 in a group of order 40320 given by a
presentation due to B.~H. Neumann.  First we construct a presentation of
the subgroup, and then we apply to it the command `TzGoGo' for different
values of the parameter `eliminationsLimit'
(including the default value 100). In fact, we also alter the
`printLevel' parameter, but this is only done in order to suppress most
of the output.  In all cases the resulting presentations cannot be
improved any more by applying the command `TzGoGo' again, i.e., they are
the best results which we can get without substituting new generators.

Similarly, we demonstrate the influence of the `saveLimit' parameter by
just continuing the preceding example for some different values of the
`saveLimit' parameter (including its default value 10), but without
changing the `eliminationsLimit' parameter which keeps its default value
100.

\Section{Elementary Tietze Transformations}

\Declaration{TzEliminate}
\Declaration{TzSearch}

Two of the Tietze option parameters which are listed in section "Tietze
Options" may strongly influence the performance and the results of the
command `TzSearch'. These are the parameters `saveLimit' and
`searchSimultaneous'. The first of them has the following effect:

When `TzSearch' has finished its main loop over all relators, then, in
general, there are relators which have changed and hence should be
handled again in another run through the whole procedure. However,
experience shows that it really does not pay to continue this way until
no more relators change. Therefore, `TzSearch' starts a new loop only if
the loop just finished has reduced the total length of the relators by at
least `saveLimit' per cent.

The default value of `saveLimit' is 10 per cent.

To understand the effect of the option `searchSimultaneous', we
have to look in more detail at how `TzSearch' proceeds:

First, it sorts the list of relators by increasing lengths. Then it
performs a loop over this list. In each step of this loop, the current
relator is treated as *short relator* $r_1$, and a subroutine is called
which loops over the succeeding relators, treating them as *long
relators*  $r_2$  and performing  the  respective  comparisons and
substitutions.

As this subroutine performs a very expensive process, it has been
implemented as a C routine in the {\GAP} kernel. For the given relator
$r_1$ of length $l_1$, say, it first determines the *minimal match
length* $l$ which is $l_1/2+1$, if $l_1$ is even, or $(l_1+1)/2$,
otherwise. Then it builds up a hash list for all subwords of length $l$
occurring in the conjugates of $r_1$ or $r_1^{-1}$, and finally it loops
over all long relators $r_2$ and compares the hash values of their
subwords of length $l$ against this list. A comparison of subwords which
is much more expensive is only done if a hash match has been found.

To improve the efficiency of this process we allow the subroutine to
handle several short relators simultaneously provided that they have the
same minimal match length.  If, for example, it handles $n$ short
relators simultaneously, then you save $n - 1$ loops over the long
relators $r_2$, but you pay for it by additional fruitless subword
comparisons. In general, you will not get the best performance by always
choosing the maximal possible number of short relators to be handled
simultaneously. In fact, the optimal choice of the number will depend on
the concrete presentation under investigation. You can use the parameter
`searchSimultaneous' to prescribe an upper bound for the number of
short relators to be handled simultaneously.

The default value of `searchSimultaneous' is 20.

\Declaration{TzSearchEqual}

The Tietze option parameter `searchSimultaneous' is used by `TzSearchEqual'
in the same way as described for `TzSearch'. However, `TzSearchEqual' does
not use the parameter `saveLimit': The loop over the relators is executed
exactly once.

\Section{Tietze Transformations that introduce new Generators}

Some of the Tietze transformation commands listed so far may eliminate
generators and hence change the given presentation to a presentation on a
subset of the given set of generators, but they all do *not* introduce
new generators. However, sometimes there will be the need to substitute
certain words as new generators in order to improve a presentation.
Therefore {\GAP} offers the two commands `TzSubstitute' and
`TzSubstituteCyclicJoins' which introduce new generators.

\Declaration{TzSubstitute}

There is still another property of the command `TzSubstitute' which should
be mentioned. If, for instance, `word' is an abstract word, a call

\begintt
TzSubstitute( P, word );
\endtt

is more or less equivalent to

\begintt
AddGenerator( P );
g := GeneratorsOfPresentation(P)[Length(GeneratorsOfPresentation(P))];
AddRelator( P, g^-1 * word );
\endtt

However, there is a difference: If you are tracing generator images and
preimages of <P> through the Tietze transformations applied to <P> (see
"Tracing generator images through Tietze transformations"), then
`TzSubstitute', as a Tietze transformation of <P>, will update and save the
respective lists, whereas a call of the function `AddGenerator' (which does
not perform a Tietze transformation) will delete these lists and hence
terminate the tracing.

As an example of an application of the command `TzSubstitute' in its second
form we handle a subgroup of index 266 in the Janko group $J_1$.

\beginexample

Here we do not get any more progress without substituting a new generator.

{\GAP} cannot substitute a new generator without extending the total length,
so we have to explicitly ask for it by using the second form of the command
`TzSubstitute'. Our problem is to chose appropriate values for the arguments
<n> and <eliminate>. For this purpose it may be helpful to print out a list

If we save a copy of the current presentation, then later we will be able to
restart the computation from the current state.

Just for demonstration we make an inconvenient choice:

\beginexample

#I  substituting new generator _x31 defined by _x23*_x30
#I  eliminating _x23 = _x31*_x30^-1

This presentation is worse than the one we have saved, so we restart from

\Section{Tracing generator images through Tietze transformations}

Any sequence of Tietze transformations applied to a presentation, starting
from some presentation $P_1$ and ending up with some presentation $P_2$,
defines an  isomorphism, $\varphi$ say, between the groups defined by $P_1$
and $P_2$, respectively. Sometimes it is desirable to know the images of the
(old) generators of $P_1$ or the preimages of the (new) generators of $P_2$
under $\varphi$. The {\GAP} Tietze transformation functions are able to trace
these images. This is not automatically done because the involved words may
grow to tremendous length, but it will be done if you  explicitly  request
for it by calling the function `TzInitGeneratorImages'.

\Section{DecodeTree}

\Declaration{DecodeTree}
\index{secondary subgroup generators}

In order to explain the effect of this command we need to insert a few
remarks on the subgroup presentation commands described in section
"Subgroup Presentations". All these commands have the common property
that in the process of constructing a presentation for a given subgroup
<H> of a finitely presented group <G> they first build up a highly
redundant list of generators of <H> which consists of an (in general
small) list of ``primary'' generators, followed by an (in general
large) list of ``secondary'' generators, and then construct a
presentation $P_0$, say, *on a sublist of these generators* by rewriting
the defining relators of <G>. This sublist contains all primary, but, at
least in general, by far not all secondary generators.
\index{primary subgroup generators}

The role of the primary generators depends on the concrete choice of the
subgroup presentation command. If the Modified Todd-Coxeter method is
used, they are just the given generators of <H>, whereas in the case of
the Reduced Reidemeister-Schreier algorithm they are constructed by the
program.

Each of the secondary generators is defined by a word of length two in
the preceding generators and their inverses. By historical reasons, the
list of these definitions is called the *subgroup generators tree*
though in fact it is not a tree but rather a kind of bush.
\index{subgroup generators tree}

Now we have to distinguish two cases. If $P_0$ has been constructed by
the Reduced Reidemeister-Schreier routines, it is a presentation of
<H>. However, if the Modified Todd-Coxeter routines have been used
instead, then the relators in $P_0$ are valid relators of <H>, but they
do not necessarily define <H>. We handle these cases in turn, starting
with the latter one.

In fact, we could easily receive a presentation of <H> also in this case
if we extended $P_0$ by adding to it all the secondary generators which
are not yet contained in it and all the definitions from the generators
tree as additional generators and relators. Then we could recursively
eliminate all secondary generators by Tietze transformations using the
new relators. However, this procedure turns out to be too inefficient to
be of interest.

Instead, we use the so called *decoding tree* procedure (see \cite{AMW82},
\cite{AR84}). It proceeds as follows.

Starting from $P = P_0$, it runs through a number of steps in each of
which it eliminates the current ``last'' generator (with respect to
the list of all primary and secondary generators). If the last generator
<g>, say, is a primary generator, then the procedure terminates. Otherwise
it checks whether there is a relator in the current presentation which
can be used to substitute <g> by a Tietze transformation. If so, this is
done. Otherwise, and only then, the tree definition of <g> is added to
<P> as a new relator, and the generators involved are added as new
generators if they have not yet been contained in <P>. Subsequently, <g>
is eliminated.

Note that the extension of <P> by one or two new generators is *not* a
Tietze transformation. In general, it will change the isomorphism type
of the group defined by <P>. However, it is a remarkable property of
this procedure, that at the end, i.e., as soon as all secondary
generators have been eliminated, it provides a presentation $P = P_1$,
say, which defines a group isomorphic to <H>. In fact, it is this
presentation which is returned by the command `DecodeTree' and hence by
the command `PresentationSubgroupMtc'.

If, in the other case, the presentation $P_0$ has been constructed by the
Reduced Reidemeister-Schreier algorithm, then $P_0$ itself is a
presentation of <H>, and the corresponding subgroup presentation command
(`PresentationSubgroupRrs' or `PresentationNormalClosureRrs') just
returns $P_0$.

As mentioned in section "Subgroup Presentations", we recommend to further
simplify this presentation before you use it. The standard way to do
this is to start from $P_0$ and to apply suitable Tietze transformations,
e.g., by calling the commands `TzGo' or `TzGoGo'. This is probably the
most efficient approach, but you will end up with a presentation on some
unpredictable set of generators. As an alternative, {\GAP} offers you
the `DecodeTree' command which you can use to eliminate all secondary
generators (provided that there are no space or time problems). For this
purpose, the subgroup presentation commands do not only return the
resulting presentation, but also the tree (together with some associated
lists) as a kind of side result in a component `<P>!.tree' of the
resulting presentation <P>.

Note, however, that the decoding tree routines will not work correctly
any more on a presentation from which generators have already been
eliminated by Tietze transformations. Therefore, to prevent you from
getting wrong results by calling the `DecodeTree' command in such a
situation, {\GAP} will automatically remove the subgroup generators tree
from a presentation as soon as one of the generators is substituted by a
Tietze transformation.

Nevertheless, a certain misuse of the command is still possible, and we
want to explicitly warn you from this. The reason is that the Tietze
option parameters described in section "Tietze Transformations" apply to
the `DecodeTree' command as well. Hence, in case of inadequate values of
these parameters, it may happen that the `DecodeTree' routine stops
before all the secondary generators have vanished. In this case {\GAP}
will display an appropriate warning. Then you should change the
respective parameters and continue the process by calling the
`DecodeTree' command again. Otherwise, if you would apply Tietze
transformations, it might happen because of the convention described
above that the tree is removed and that you end up with a wrong
presentation.

After a successful run of the `DecodeTree' command it is convenient to
further simplify the resulting presentation by suitable Tietze
transformations.

As an example of an explicit call of the `DecodeTree' command we compute
two presentations of a subgroup of order $384$ in a group of order
$6912$. In both cases we use the Reduced Reidemeister-Schreier
algorithm, but in the first run we just apply the Tietze transformations
offered by the `TzGoGo' command with its default parameters, whereas in
the second run we call the `DecodeTree' command before.

gap> H := Subgroup( G, [ Comm(a^-1,b^-1), Comm(a^-1,b), Comm(a,b) ] );;

We use the Reduced Reidemeister Schreier method and default Tietze

#I  there are 3 generators and 20 relators of total length 466
\endexample

We end up with 20 relators of total length 466. Now we repeat the
procedure, but we call the decoding tree algorithm before doing the Tietze
transformations.

This time we end up with a shorter presentation.

\Section{Tietze Options}

Several of the Tietze transformation commands described above are
controlled by certain parameters, the *Tietze options*, which often have
a tremendous influence on their performance and results.  However, in
each application of the commands, an appropriate choice of these option
parameters will depend on the concrete presentation under investigation.
Therefore we have implemented the Tietze options in such a way that they
are associated to the presentation: Each presentation
keeps its own set of Tietze option parameters as an attribute.

\Declaration{TzOptions}

The following Tietze options are recognized by {\GAP}:

\beginitems
`protected':&
  The first `protected' generators in a presentation <P> are
  protected from being eliminated by the Tietze transformations
  functions.  There are only  two exceptions:  The option
  `protected'   is   ignored   by   the   functions
  `TzEliminate(<P>,<gen>)' and `TzSubstitute(<P>,<n>,<eliminate>)'
  because they explicitly specify the generator to be eliminated.
  The default value of `protected' is 0.

`eliminationsLimit':&
  Whenever the elimination phase of the `TzGo' command is entered
  for a presentation <P>,  then it  will eliminate at most
  `eliminationsLimit' generators (except for further ones which
  have turned out to  be trivial). Hence you may use  the
  `eliminationsLimit' parameter as a break criterion for the `TzGo'
  command. Note, however, that it is ignored by the `TzEliminate'
  command. The default value of `eliminationsLimit' is 100.

`expandLimit':&
  Whenever the routine for eliminating more than 1 generators is
  called for a presentation <P> by the `TzEliminate' command or the
  elimination phase of the `TzGo' command, then it saves the given
  total length of the relators, and subsequently it checks the
  current total length against its value before each elimination.
  If the total length has increased to more than `expandLimit'
  per cent of its original value, then the routine returns instead
  of  eliminating another generator.  Hence you may use the
  `expandLimit' parameter as a break criterion for the `TzGo'
  command. The default value of `expandLimit' is 150.

`generatorsLimit':&
  Whenever the elimination phase of the `TzGo' command is entered
  for a presentation <P> with $n$ generators, then it will
  eliminate at most $n - $`generatorsLimit' generators (except
  for generators which turn out to be trivial). Hence you may use
  the `generatorsLimit' parameter as a break criterion for the
  `TzGo' command. The default value of `generatorsLimit' is 0.

`lengthLimit':&
  The Tietze transformation commands will never eliminate  a
  generator of a presentation <P>, if they cannot exclude the
  possibility that the resulting total length of the relators
  exceeds the value of `lengthLimit'. The default value of
  `lengthLimit' is `infinity'.

`loopLimit':&
  Whenever the `TzGo' command is called for a presentation <P>,
  then it will loop over at most `loopLimit' of its basic
  steps. Hence you may use the `loopLimit' parameter as a break
  criterion for  the `TzGo'  command. The  default value of
  `loopLimit' is `infinity'.

`printLevel':&
  Whenever  Tietze transformation commands are called for  a
  presentation <P> with `printLevel' $= 0$, they will not
  provide any output except for error messages. If `printLevel'
  $= 1$, they will display some reasonable amount of output which
  allows you to watch the progress of the computation and to decide
  about your next commands. In the case `printLevel' $= 2$, you
  will get a much more generous amount of output. Finally, if
  `printLevel' $= 3$, various messages on internal details will
  be added. The default value of `printLevel' is 1.

`saveLimit':&
  Whenever the `TzSearch' command has finished its main loop over
  all relators of a presentation <P>, then it checks whether during
  this loop the total length of the relators has been reduced by at
  least `saveLimit' per cent. If this is the case, then
  `TzSearch' repeats its procedure instead of returning. Hence you
  may use the `saveLimit' parameter as a break criterion for the
  `TzSearch' command and, in particular, for the search phase of
  the `TzGo' command. The default value of `saveLimit' is 10.

`searchSimultaneous':&
  Whenever the `TzSearch' or the `TzSearchEqual' command is called
  for a presentation <P>, then it is allowed to handle up to
  `searchSimultaneous' short relators simultaneously (see for
  the description of the `TzSearch' command for more details). The
  choice of this parameter may heavily influence the performance as
  well as the result of the `TzSearch' and the `TzSearchEqual'
  commands and hence also of the search phase of the `TzGo'
  command. The default value of `searchSimultaneous' is 20.

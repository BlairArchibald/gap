\PreliminaryChapter{Additive Magmas}

This chapter deals with domains that are closed under addition `+',
which are called *near-additive magmas* in {\GAP}.
Together with the domains closed under multiplication `\*', (see~"Magmas"),
they are the basic algebraic structures.
In many cases, the addition is commutative (see~"IsAdditivelyCommutative"),
the domain is called an *additive magma* then;
every module (see~"Modules"), vector space (see~"Vector Spaces"),
ring (see~"Rings"), or field (see~"Fields and Division Rings")
is an additive magma.
In the cases of al *(near-)additive magma-with-zero* or
*(near-)additive magma-with-inverses*,
additional additive structure is present
(see~"(Near-)Additive Magma Categories").

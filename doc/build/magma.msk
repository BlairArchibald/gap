\Chapter{Magmas}

This chapter deals with domains (see~"Domains and their Elements")
that are closed under multiplication `\*'.
Following~\cite{Bourbaki70}, we call them *magmas* in {\GAP}.
Together with the domains closed under addition `+', (see~"Additive Magmas"),
they are the basic algebraic structures;
every semigroup (see~"Semigroups"), monoid (see~"Monoids"),
group (see~"Groups"), ring (see~"Rings"),
or field (see~"Fields and Division Rings") is a magma.
In the cases of a *magma-with-one* or *magma-with-inverses*,
additional multiplicative structure is present, see~"Magma Categories".
For functions to create free magmas, see~"Free Magmas".

The underlying operations for which methods can be installed are the
following.

\Declaration{MagmaByGenerators}
\Declaration{MagmaWithOneByGenerators}
\Declaration{MagmaWithInversesByGenerators}

Substructures of a magma can be formed as follows.

\Declaration{Submagma}
\Declaration{SubmagmaWithOne}
\Declaration{SubmagmaWithInverses}

The following functions can be used to regard a collection as a magma.

\Declaration{AsMagma}
\Declaration{AsSubmagma}


The following function creates a new magma which is the original
magma with a zero adjoined.
\Declaration{InjectionZeroMagma}

\Section{Magmas Defined by Multiplication Tables}

The most elementary (but of course usually not recommended) way to implement
a magma with only few elements is via a multiplication table.

*Note* that `IsAssociative' and `IsCommutative' always refer to the
multiplication of a domain.
If a magma <M> has also an additive structure, e.g., if <M> is a ring
(see~"Rings"), then the addition `+' is always assumed to be associative and
commutative, see~"Arithmetic Operations for Elements".

\Chapter{Mappings}

\index{functions}
\index{relations}
A *mapping* in {\GAP} is what is called a ``function'' in mathematics.
{\GAP} also implements *generalized mappings* in which one element might
have several images, these can be imagined as subsets of the cartesian
product and are often called ``relations''.

Most operations are declared for general mappings and therefore this manual
often  refers to ``(general) mappings'', unless you deliberatily need the
generalization you can ignore the ``general'' bit and just read
it as ``mappings''.

\FileHeader{mapping}[1]

For mappings which preserve an algebraic structure a *kernel* is defined.
Depending on the structure preserved the operation to compute this kernel is
called differently, see section~"Mappings which are Compatible with Algebraic
Structures".

Some technical details of general mappings are described in section~"General
Mappings".

%%  The general support for mappings is due to Thomas Breuer.

\Section{Mappings which are Compatible with Algebraic Structures}

From an algebraical point of view, the most important mappings are those
which are compatible with a structure. For Magmas, Groups and Rings, {\GAP}
supports the following four types of such mappings:

1. General mappings that respect multiplication

2. General mappings that respect addition

3. General mappings that respect scalar mult.

4. General mappings that respect multiplicative and additive structure

(Very technical note: GAP defines categories `IsSPGeneralMapping' and
`IsNonSPGeneralMapping'. The distinction between these is orthogonal to the
Structure Compatibility described here and should not be confused.)

Mappings that are defined on a group and respect multiplication and inverses
are group homomorphisms. Chapter~"Group Homomorphisms" explains them in more
detail.

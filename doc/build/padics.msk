\PreliminaryChapter{p-adic Numbers}

In this chapter $p$ is always a (fixed) prime.

The $p$-adic numbers $Q_p$ are the completion of the rational numbers with
respect to the valuation $\nu_p(p^v\frac{a}{b})=v$ if $p$ divides neither
$a$ nor $b$. They form a field of characteristic 0 which nevertheless shows
some behaviour of the finite field with $p$ elements.

A $p$-adic numbers can be approximated by a ``$p$-adic expansion'' which is 
similar to the decimal expansion used for the reals (but written from left
to right). So for example if
$p=2$, the numbers $1$,$2$,$3$,$4$,$\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$ are
represented as $1(2)$, $0.1(2)$, $1.1(2)$, $0.01(2)$, $10(2)$ and
$0.0101(2)$.  Approximation means to ignore powers of $p$, so for example
with only 2 digits accuracy $\frac{4}{5}$ would be approximated as
$0.01(2)$.
The important difference to the decimal approximation is that
$p$-adic approximation is a ring homomorphism on the subrings of $p$-adic
numbers whose valuation is bounded from below.

In {\GAP}, $p$-adic numbers are represented by approximations. A family of
(approximated) $p$-adic numbers consists of $p$-adic numbers with a certain
precision and arithmetic with these numbers is done with this precision.

\Section{Pure p-adic Numbers}

Pure $p$-adic numbers are the $p$-adic numbers described so far.

\Declaration{PurePadicNumberFamily}

\>PadicNumber(<fam>,<rat>)!{for pure padics}

returns the element of the $p$-adic number family <fam> that is used to
represent the rational number <rat>.

$p$-adic numbers allow the usual operations for fields.

\Section{Extensions of the p-adic Numbers}

The usual Kronecker construction with an irreducible polynomial can be used
to construct extensions of the $p$-adic numbers. 
Let $L$ be such an
extension. Then there is a subfield $K\<L$ such that $K$ is an unramified
extension of the $p$-adic numbers and $L/K$ is purely ramified.
(For an explanation of ``ramification'' see for example \cite{neukirch},
section II.7 or another book on algebraic number theory. Essentially, an
extension $L$ of the $p$-adic numbers generated
by a rational polynomial $f$ is unramified if $f$ remains squarefree modulo
$p$ and is completely ramified if modulo $p$ the polynomial $f$ is a power of
a linear factor while remaining irreducible over the $p$-adic numbers.)
The representation of extensions of $p$-adic numbers in {\GAP} uses this
subfield.

This directory contains files to wrap up a distribution of GAP4, compiling
GAP under linux and with the Winooze cross-compiler, creating completion
files, running the test files, creating the manuals,
TeXing them, creating an html version and finally wrapping everything up.

The distribution is built under /scratch/gap4dist

The file `setvar' will need editing depending on the linux version used and
the cvs path.

The files assume that

- cvs path set in `setvar'.
- standard `gcc' setup under linux
- `zoo' exists
- under /user/gnuwin32 the cygnus cross-compiler exists

To build, go into this directory and call

  doit nr

where nr is the number of the version to be wrapped up.

Description of archive/ordinary files and directories
-----------------------------------------------------

The following files (in this ftp directory) contain parts of the  GAP 4.X
distribution, where X is the the current revision  number  of  GAP  (i.e.
replace X by the appropriate revision number for the current GAP  in  the
filenames listed below; also XXX, YYY represent versions or dates, and N,
where designated represents an integer).

If disk space is limited or the network connection is slow  it  might  be
preferrable to assemble only a partial distribution from these files.  We
list .zoo  files  below  (but  the  description  remains  valid  for  the
corresponding .zip, .tar.gz, ... archives).

Except for the accpkgXXX and deppkgYYY package archives and  archives  in
the  accpkg/  and  deposit/pkg/  directories,  all  archives  should   be
extracted at the ``top'' level (i.e. they contain  a  gap4rX/  directory,
for some integer X; a directory in brackets or listed as being  contained
is a subdirectory of gap4rX/ - so `Contains lib/ ...'  means  that  after
extraction there will be a gap4rX/lib/ directory).

A + in the category column indicates that the material is not included in
the omnibus editions (gap4rX.zoo, gapmac4rX.zoo, gappc4rX.zoo).
